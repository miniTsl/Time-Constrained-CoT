**Coarse Reasoning**
The circumference of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\). Given \(C = 60\) meters, we can solve for \(r\) as \(r = \frac{60}{2\pi} \approx \frac{60}{6.28} \approx 9.55\). Since the radius must be an integer, the largest possible radius is 9 meters.

**Fine Reasoning**
To find the largest possible integer radius for Daphne's circle, we start with the formula for the circumference of a circle: \(C = 2\pi r\). Given that the circumference \(C = 60\) meters, we can substitute and solve for \(r\):

\[60 = 2\pi r\]
\[r = \frac{60}{2\pi}\]
\[r = \frac{30}{\pi}\]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), we get:

\[r \approx \frac{30}{3.14159} \approx 9.5493\]

Since the radius must be an integer, the largest possible integer value for \(r\) is 9 meters.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}
