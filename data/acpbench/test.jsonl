The robot has an arm that can pick up a key when the key is in same location as the robot and the arm is empty.  There are 3 keys in 1 different shapes: Key key0-1 is of shape shape0, Key key0-2 is of shape shape0, Key key0-0 is of shape shape0.  Currently, the robot is at position f1-2f and its arm is empty. All the positions are open except the following: f0-3f has shape0 shaped lock, f4-0f has shape0 shaped lock, f4-4f has shape0 shaped lock. Key key0-0 is at position f2-2f. Key key0-2 is at position f4-3f. Key key0-1 is at position f1-2f. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Key key0-1 is at f3-2f location, Key key0-0 is at f2-2f location, and Key key0-2 is at f1-4f location.\nQuestion: Which fact must hold at some point on any way to the goal from the current state?", "choices": ["Key key0-2 is at f1-2f location", "Robot is holding key0-2", "Key key0-1 is at f0-2f location", "Key key0-1 is at f3-3f location"], "answer": "B"}
