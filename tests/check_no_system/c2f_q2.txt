**Coarse Reasoning**
We have a system of three linear equations in three variables: x, y, and z. To find the point of intersection, we need to solve this system simultaneously. First, we can rearrange the given equation to form three equations in standard form (Ax + By + Cz = D). Then, we can use methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix algebra to solve for the variables. The point of intersection will be the solution to this system.

**Fine Reasoning**
1. Rearranging the given equation:
   a) x - 2 = 3y/4
   b) y + 1 = 4z/12 - 4/3
   c) x - y + z = 5

2. Simplifying the second equation:
   y = (12/4)z/12 - 4/3
   y = 3z/12 - 4/3

3. Substituting y from the second equation into the first equation:
   x - 2 = (3/4)(3z/12 - 4/3)
   x - 2 = (9/12)z - (12/12)
   x - 2 = (9/12)z - 1

4. Simplifying the third equation:
   x - y + z = 5
   x - (3z/12 - 4/3) + z = 5

5. Substituting y from the second equation into the third equation:
   x - (3/12)(12z - 36) + z = 5
   x - (9/12)z + (36/12) + z = 5

6. Combining like terms:
   x + (11/12)z = 21/12

7. Multiplying both sides by 12 to eliminate the fraction:
   12x + (11z) = 21

8. Rearranging the equation:
   12x + 11z - 21 = 0

9. We now have a linear equation in two variables, which can be solved using methods like the substitution or elimination method or matrix algebra. However, since the given system already has three equations, we can use the third equation to eliminate z from the new equation.

10. Substituting z from the first equation into the new equation:
    12(x - 2) + 11((3/4)(3z/12 - 4/3)) - 21 = 0

11. Simplifying and rearranging:
    12x - 24 + (9/4)z - (33/4) - 21 = 0
    12x - (33/4) - (15/4)z = 24

12. Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
    48x - (33) - 15z = 96

13. Rearranging the equation:
    48x + 15z - 33 = 96

14. Now we have a linear equation in two variables, x and z. We can solve this equation using the substitution or elimination method or matrix algebra. However, since we have only two variables, we can solve this equation directly for one variable, say z.

15. Solving for z:
    z = (96 - 48x + 33)/15

16. Substituting z back into the first equation:
    x - 2 = (3/4)((96 - 48x + 33)/15 - 4/3)

17. Solving for x:
    x - 2 = (288 - 192x + 132)/60
    x - 2 = (132 - 192x)/60
    x - 2 = (-140 + 192x)/60
    x = (140 - 192x)/60 + 2
    x(192) + 140(60) = 192x + 8400 = 140y + 12000
    x(192) - 140y = 3600
    x = (3600 + 140y)/192

18. Substituting z back into the third equation:
    x - y + z = 5
    x - y + ((96 - 48x + 33)/15) = 5

19. Solving for y:
    y = (5 - x + 48x - 33)/15
    y = (43 - 47x)/15

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection of the given line and the plane is \boxed{\left(\frac{3600 + 140y}{192}, y, \frac{96 - 48x + 33}{15}\right)}. To find specific values for x, y, and z, we can choose a specific value for y and solve for x and z using the equations derived above.

**Fine Reasoning**
1. From the line equation, we have:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]
   This implies:
   \[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2\]

2. Substitute these into the plane equation:
   \[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]
   Simplify and solve for $t$:
   \[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
   \[11t + 5 = 5\]
   \[11t = 0\]
   \[t = 0\]

3. Substitute $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

The given equations represent a line in three-dimensional space. The first equation can be rewritten as $4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) = z - 2$. This implies that $x - 2$, $y + 1$, and $z - 2$ are all multiples of 3. The second equation, $x - y + z = 5$, can be used to find the specific values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy both equations. Since $x - 2$ is a multiple of 3, let's assume $x - 2 = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Then, $x = 3k + 2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $3k + 2 - y + z = 5$. Since $z - 2$ is also a multiple of 3, let's assume $z - 2 = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then, $z = 3m + 2$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $3k + 2 - y + 3m + 2 = 5$. Simplifying, we get $3k + 3m - y = 1$. Since $y + 1$ is a multiple of 3, let's assume $y + 1 = 3n$ for some integer $n$. Then, $y = 3n - 1$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $3k + 3m - (3n - 1) = 1$. Simplifying, we get $3k + 3m - 3n = 2$. This equation has infinitely many solutions, but we can find one specific solution by choosing values for $k$, $m$, and $n$ that satisfy the equation. For example, if we choose $k = 1$, $m = 0$, and $n = 1$, we get $x = 5$, $y = 2$, and $z = 2$. Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(5, 2, 2)}$.

**Fine Reasoning**
The given equations represent a line in three-dimensional space. The first equation can be rewritten as $4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) = z - 2$. This implies that $x - 2$, $y + 1$, and $z - 2$ are all multiples of 3. The second equation, $x - y + z = 5$, can be used to find the specific values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy both equations.

Let's start by finding the general form of the line. From the first equation, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t$ as follows:
\[x = 2 + 3t,\]
\[y = -1 + 4t,\]
\[z = 2 + 12t.\]

Substituting these expressions into the second equation, we get:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[3t + 4t + 12t = 5 - 2 - 1,\]
\[19t = 2.\]

Solving for $t$, we get:
\[t = \frac{2}{19}.\]

Substituting this value of $t$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = 2 + 3 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{44}{19},\]
\[y = -1 + 4 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{6}{19},\]
\[z = 2 + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{46}{19}.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{\left(\frac{44}{19}, \frac{6}{19}, \frac{46}{19}\right)}$.

Solving for $t$ gives $t = 0$. Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parameterized equations gives the intersection point $(2, -1, 2)$.

**Fine Reasoning**

To find the intersection, let's set up the system of equations:

So I have this problem here: find the point where the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) intersects the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, first things first, I need to understand what this line represents. It looks like it's given in parametric form, where the ratios are equal. Maybe I can set a parameter \(t\) equal to these ratios, so:

\[
t = \frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

That means I can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):

\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
\]

Now, since this point lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I can substitute these expressions into the plane equation:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Simplifying that:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5 \\
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5 \\
11t + 5 = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0 \\
t = 0
\]

So, \(t = 0\). Plugging this back into the parametric equations gives:

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

**Fine Reasoning**

Let's go through this step by step to make sure everything is correct. The line is given by the symmetric equations:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

These are the standard form of symmetric equations for a line in 3D space, where the denominators are the direction numbers of the line, and the numerators are the differences between the variables and the coordinates of a point on the line. So, the line passes through the point \((2, -1, 2)\) and has direction vector \(\vec{d} = \langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\).

To find the intersection with the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I need to find a point that lies on both the line and the plane. One way to do this is to express the coordinates \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter, and then substitute these expressions into the plane equation to solve for the parameter.

Let's set the symmetric equations equal to a parameter \(t\):

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):

\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
\]

Now, since this point \((x, y, z)\) lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we can substitute the expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Let's simplify the left side:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5 \\
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5 \\
(11t) + (5) = 5 \\
11t + 5 = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0 \\
t = 0
\]

So, the parameter \(t\) is 0. Plugging \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations gives:

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

To verify, let's check if this point satisfies both the line and the plane equations.

First, check if it satisfies the plane equation:

\[
x - y + z = 2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
\]

Yes, it does.

Now, check if it satisfies the line equations. Plug \(x = 2\), \(y = -1\), and \(z = 2\) into the symmetric equations:

\[
\frac{2 - 2}{3} = 0, \quad \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = 0, \quad \frac{2 - 2}{12} = 0
\]

All three expressions equal 0, so the point lies on the line.

Therefore, the point of intersection is indeed \((2, -1, 2)\).

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2, -1, 2)} \]

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we first need to express the given line in a more manageable form.
We can rewrite the given line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$, which gives us the parametric equations $x = 3t + 2$, $y = 4t - 1$, and $z = 12t + 2$.

## Step 2: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the value of t at the point of intersection.
Substituting $x = 3t + 2$, $y = 4t - 1$, and $z = 12t + 2$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$, we get $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5$.

## Step 3: Solve for t.
Simplifying the equation $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5$, we get $11t + 5 = 5$, which simplifies to $11t = 0$. Solving for t, we find $t = 0$.

## Step 4: Substitute the value of t back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations $x = 3t + 2$, $y = 4t - 1$, and $z = 12t + 2$, we get $x = 2$, $y = -1$, and $z = 2$.

## Step 5: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have two equations: $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing each variable in terms of one variable using the first equation.
From the first equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$ as $x = 3y + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 3: Substitute the expression for $x$ into the second equation to eliminate $x$.
Substituting $x = 3y + 2 + 12z$ into $x - y + z = 5$ gives $3y + 2 + 12z - y + z = 5.$

## Step 4: Simplify the resulting equation to solve for $y$ in terms of $z$.
Simplifying the equation gives $2y + 13z = 3.$

## Step 5: Express $y$ in terms of $z$.
$y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}.$

## Step 6: Substitute the expression for $y$ into the expression for $x$ to find $x$ in terms of $z$.
Substituting $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ into $x = 3y + 2 + 12z$ gives $x = 3\left(\frac{3 - 13z}{2}\right) + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 7: Simplify the expression for $x$.
Simplifying the expression gives $x = \frac{9 - 39z}{2} + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 8: Further simplify the expression for $x$.
$x = \frac{9 - 39z + 4 + 24z}{2}.$

## Step 9: Combine like terms in the numerator.
$x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}.$

## Step 10: Now we have the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$.
We have $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ and $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}.$

## Step 11: Substitute the expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$ to solve for $z$.
Substituting $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ and $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ into $x - y + z = 5$ gives $\frac{13 - 15z}{2} - \frac{3 - 13z}{2} + z = 5.$

## Step 12: Simplify the equation to solve for $z$.
Simplifying the equation gives $\frac{10 - 28z}{2} + z = 5.$

## Step 13: Combine like terms and solve for $z$.
$10 - 28z + 2z = 10.$

## Step 14: Combine like terms.
$-26z = 0.$

## Step 15: Solve for $z$.
$z = 0.$

## Step 16: Substitute the value of $z$ back into the expression for $x$ to find the value of $x$.
Substituting $z = 0$ into $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ gives $x = \frac{13 - 15(0)}{2}.$

## Step 17: Simplify the expression for $x$.
$x = \frac{13}{2}.$

## Step 18: Substitute the value of $z$ back into the expression for $y$ to find the value of $y$.
Substituting $z = 0$ into $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ gives $y = \frac{3 - 13(0)}{2}.$

## Step 19: Simplify the expression for $y$.
$y = \frac{3}{2}.$

## Step 20: The point of intersection is $\left(\frac{13}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{13}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 0\right)}$

## Step 2:  Now, we need to find the point of intersection of this line with the plane $x - y + z = 5.$ To do this, we substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane. This gives us \[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]

## Step 3:  Simplifying the equation, we get \[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5.\] Combining like terms, we have \[5 + 11t = 5.\]

## Step 4:  Solving for $t$, we subtract 5 from both sides to get \[11t = 0.\] Then, we divide both sides by 11 to find \[t = 0.\]

## Step 5:  Now that we have the value of $t$, we can substitute it back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point of intersection. Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations, we get \[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]

## Step 6:  Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the plane is $(2, -1, 2)$.

   \]

3. **Solve for $t$:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2 + 3t - 4t + 1 + 2 + 12t = 5
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   5t + 5 = 5
   \]
   Solve for $t$:
   \[
   5t = 0 \implies t = 0
   \]

4. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point:**
   Substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations:
   \[
   x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2
   \]
   Thus, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

**Final Answer:**
The point of intersection of the line and the plane is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

**Coarse Reasoning**
To find the point of intersection, we can substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the line equation into the plane equation and solve for the parameter $t$. The solution will give us the value of $t$ which we can then use to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

**Fine Reasoning**
Given the line equation:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

We can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:
\[x = 3t + 2\]
\[y = 4t - 1\]
\[z = 12t + 2\]

Substituting these into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Simplifying:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
\[11t + 5 = 5\]
\[11t = 0\]
\[t = 0\]

Substituting $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

**Final Answer** \boxed{(2, -1, 2)}

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-1_8b
To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first need to express the line in parametric form. The line is given by the parametric equations:
$$x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.$$

Next, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
$$3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.$$

Simplifying the equation gives:
$$3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,$$
$$9t + 5 = 5,$$
$$9t = 0,$$
$$t = 0.$$

Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations of the line gives the point of intersection:
$$x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,$$
$$y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,$$
$$z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.$$

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-20b
To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute this into the equation of the plane to solve for the parameter.

The line is given by:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

Let's denote the common ratio as $t$, so we have:
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

The equation of the plane is:
\[x - y + z = 5.\]

Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the line into the plane equation, we get:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]
\[11t + 5 = 5.\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[11t = 0.\]

Solving for $t$:
\[t = 0.\]

Now, substituting $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the point of intersection:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.
The final answer is \boxed{(2, -1, 2)}.

To find the point of intersection of the given line and plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute the resulting expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane. The line is given by
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]
Let's denote the common parameter by $t$. Thus, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ as follows:
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

The equation of the plane is given by
\[x - y + z = 5.\]

Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ into the plane's equation, we get:
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]

Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for $t$. Let's do this calculation.

 **Coarse Reasoning**
We can write the equation of the line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t$ for some parameter $t$.
Then $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$.
Substituting into the equation of the plane, we get $2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5$.
Simplifying, we find $t = 0$, so the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

**Fine Reasoning**
Substituting $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane, we get
\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]
Simplifying, we have $18t = 3$, so $t = \frac{1}{6}$.
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we find
\[x = 2 + 3\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2},\]
\[y = -1 + 4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = -1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1}{3},\]
and
\[z = 2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = 2 + 2 = 4.\]
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{1}{3}, 4\right)$.

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection is $\boxed{\left(\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{1}{3}, 4\right)}$.

 **Coarse Reasoning**
The given line can be rewritten as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$. This is a line in parametric form, where $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$.

We can substitute these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$ to find the value of $t$ at the intersection point.

**Fine Reasoning**
Substituting $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5.\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[5 + 11t = 5.\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[11t = 0.\]
Dividing both sides by 11 gives:
\[t = 0.\]

Now we can substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2,\]
\[y = -1 + 4(0) = -1,\]
\[z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]
So the intersection point is $(2, -1, 2)$.

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection of the line and the plane is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$.
The answer is $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$.

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
Alright, so I've got this problem here that involves finding the point where a line intersects with a plane. The line is given in parametric form, and the plane has its own equation. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, let's write down what we have:

The line is:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

And the plane is:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

I need to find the coordinates (x, y, z) where these two intersect.

Okay, so the line is defined parametrically. From the first part of the ratio, it looks like x increases by 3 for every unit increase in some parameter t, similarly for y and z. So, maybe I can express x, y, and z in terms of a parameter t.

Let me set:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

Then, solving for x, y, and z:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

So now, I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of t.

Next, since this line lies on the plane x - y + z = 5, I can substitute these expressions into the plane's equation and solve for t.

Substituting:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me simplify that:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combining like terms:

\[ (3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5 \]

\[ (11t) + (5) = 5 \]

So,

\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]

Therefore,

\[t = 0\]

Now that I have t = 0, I can plug this back into the expressions for x, y, and z to find the specific point of intersection.

For x:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]

For y:

\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]

For z:

\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point should be (2, -1, 2).

Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting again:

Given the line:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

Then:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

Plugging into the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Simplify:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[ (3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5 \]

\[ (11t) + (5) = 5 \]

\[11t = 0\]\[t = 0\]

Then:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using vectors or something else, but I think this method is straightforward and efficient.

Just to be thorough, let's verify if this point actually satisfies both equations.

First, check the line equation:

\[\frac{2 - 2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = \frac{2 - 2}{12} = \frac{0}{3} = \frac{0}{4} = \frac{0}{12} = 0\]

So, yes, it satisfies the line equation.

Now, check the plane equation:

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Perfect, it matches the plane's equation.

Therefore, the point of intersection is indeed (2, -1, 2).

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form. Let \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). Then we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these expressions into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 11t + 5.
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0.
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).
