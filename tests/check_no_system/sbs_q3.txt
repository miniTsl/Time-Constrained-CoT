To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can first list the numbers from 3 to 99 and then check which of them are prime.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Now, let's filter the list from 3 to 99 that have a units digit of 3:

3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93

Now, we check which of these numbers are prime:

3 (yes, it's a prime number)
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 29, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 67, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 (these are the prime numbers from the list)

So, there are \boxed{15} prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's start by understanding what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

First, I should probably list all the prime numbers less than 100. I know that 2 is the first prime number, and then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. I think that's all of them, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any.

Let me list them again:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

I'll check if there are any primes less than 100 that I might have missed. Starting from 2 up to 97, I don't think I left any out.

Now, I need to see which of these have a units digit of 3. So, looking at the list:

- 3 (units digit 3)

- 13 (units digit 3)

- 23 (units digit 3)

- 43 (units digit 3)

- 53 (units digit 3)

- 73 (units digit 3)

- 83 (units digit 3)

So, these are the primes less than 100 that end with a 3: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

Let me count them: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. That's seven numbers.

Wait a minute, is there another prime number less than 100 that ends with a 3 that I might have missed? Let's see:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 33 - but 33 is divisible by 3 and 11, so it's not prime.

- 43

- 53

- 63 - 63 is divisible by 3 and 21, so not prime.

- 73

- 83

- 93 - 93 is divisible by 3 and 31, so not prime.

So, indeed, the only primes less than 100 that end with a 3 are the seven I listed earlier.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is 7.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{7} \]

## Step 1:  To find the prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3, we need to consider all the numbers less than 100 that end in 3.
## Step 2:  First, we identify the numbers less than 100 that end in 3: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.
## Step 3:  Next, we need to determine which of these numbers are prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
## Step 4:  We can start by checking each number for divisibility by any number other than 1 and itself. We can eliminate any number that is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself.
## Step 5:  Starting with 3, we can see that it is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 3.
## Step 6:  Moving on to 13, we can see that it is also a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 13.
## Step 7:  Next, 23 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 23.
## Step 8:  Then, 33 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 11.
## Step 9:  Continuing, 43 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 43.
## Step 10:  Next, 53 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 53.
## Step 11:  Then, 63 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 21.
## Step 12:  Moving on, 73 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 73.
## Step 13:  Next, 83 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 83.
## Step 14:  Finally, 93 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 31.
## Step 15:  After checking all the numbers, we find that the prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
## Step 16:  Therefore, there are $\boxed{7}$ prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$

 To solve this problem, we need to understand what a prime number is and how to identify one. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

We are asked to find the prime numbers less than 100 that end with a 3 in the units place. Let's list out the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, we need to identify which of these numbers end with a 3 in the units place. These are:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The answer is $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is: $7$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

First, I'll list all the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, from this list, I need to identify those that have a units digit of 3. Looking at the list:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

These are the primes ending with 3. Let me count them: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. That's seven numbers.

Wait a minute, is there any other prime number less than 100 that ends with 3? Let's double-check the list to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking back at the full list:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Yes, only these seven primes end with 3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without listing all the primes. Since we're dealing with numbers less than 100, perhaps I can consider the form of these numbers.

A number ending in 3 can be expressed as \(10k + 3\), where k is an integer. But since we're looking for primes, it might not help directly.

Another thought: primes greater than 5 cannot be divisible by 3, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the properties of numbers ending in 3. For example, they are odd (since they end with 3, which is odd), except for 2, but 2 doesn't end with 3 anyway.

Wait, actually, 2 is even, so it's excluded. So, all primes ending with 3 are odd.

But again, I don't know if that helps me count them more efficiently.

Maybe I should just stick with my initial approach: listing the primes less than 100 and picking those that end with 3.

Let me verify the list once more:

- 3: yes, ends with 3.

- 13: yes.

- 23: yes.

- 43: yes.

- 53: yes.

- 73: yes.

- 83: yes.

That's seven numbers.

Is there any possibility that I've missed one? Let's see:

- 3 is included.

- Next prime after 3 is 5, which doesn't end with 3.

- Then 7, no.

- 11, no.

- 13, yes.

- 17, no.

- 19, no.

- 23, yes.

- And so on up to 97.

Seems like only these seven primes end with 3.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is 7.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{7} \]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-Llama-3.1-8B
To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 100**.
2. **Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3**.

### Step 1: Identify the prime numbers less than 100

The prime numbers less than 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

### Step 2: Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3

From the list of prime numbers, we select those that end in 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Now, let's count these numbers:
- 3
- 13
- 23
- 43
- 53
- 73
- 83

There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{7}\).
