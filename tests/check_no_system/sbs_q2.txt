To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations simultaneously. We have three equations:

1. Equation of the line in three variables:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

2. The additional equation given:
   \[x - y + z = 5\]

Let's first solve the line equation for two variables, say x and y. We can rewrite the line equation as:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t
\end{cases}\]

Now substitute these expressions for x and y into the third equation:

\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + z = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3t + z = 6\]

Now we have two equations for z:

1. From the line equation:
   \[z = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2\]

2. From the simplified third equation:
   \[z = 6 - 3t\]

Equate the two expressions for z:

\[12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = 6 - 3t\]

Solve for t:

\[t = \frac{x - 2}{3} - \frac{1}{4}\]

Now substitute this expression for t back into the equation for z:

\[z = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = 6 - 3\left(\frac{x - 2}{3} - \frac{1}{4}\right)\]

Simplify the equation:

\[z = \frac{3x - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\]

Now we have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of x:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t \\
z = \frac{3x - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}\]

Substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the equation for z:

\[z = \frac{3(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\]

Now substitute the expression for z back into the third equation:

\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + \frac{3(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[6t + \frac{6(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} = 5\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[18t + 6(2 + 3t) - 10 = 15\]

Expand and simplify:

\[18t + 12 + 18t - 10 = 15\]

Combine like terms:

\[36t = 5\]

Divide both sides by 36:

\[t = \frac{1}{7}\]

Now substitute t back into the expressions for x, y, and z:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3\left(\frac{1}{7}\right) = \boxed{\frac{11}{7}} \\
y = -1 + 4\left(\frac{1}{7}\right) = \boxed{\frac{3}{7}} \\
z = \frac{3\left(\frac{11}{7}\right) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{7} - \frac{34}{21} + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{10}{21}}
\end{cases}\]

So the point of intersection is \boxed{\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{10}{21}\right)}.

**Final Answer:** \boxed{\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{10}{21}\right)}

 First, let's denote the common ratio as $k$. So we have:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k\]

From this, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $k$:

\[x = 3k + 2\]
\[y = 4k - 1\]
\[z = 12k + 2\]

Now, substitute these expressions into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:

\[(3k + 2) - (4k - 1) + (12k + 2) = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3k + 2 - 4k + 1 + 12k + 2 = 5\]
\[11k + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11k = 0\]

Divide both sides by 11:

\[k = 0\]

Now, substitute $k = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So I have this problem here. I need to find the point where a given line intersects with a plane. The line is given in a parametric form, and the plane is given by an equation. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, the line is given by:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

This looks like the symmetric equations of a line. From what I remember, in symmetric equations, the denominators represent the direction numbers of the line, and the numerators are related to a point through which the line passes.

So, from this, I can see that the line passes through the point \((2, -1, 2)\), and its direction vector is \(\langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\).

Now, the plane is given by the equation:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

I need to find the point where this line intersects this plane.

One way to do this is to parametrize the line and then substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation to solve for the parameter.

Let me parametrize the line. Since the direction vector is \(\langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\), I can let the parameter be \(t\), and write:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 2 + 3t \\
y &= -1 + 4t \\
z &= 2 + 12t
\end{align*}
\]

Now, I substitute these expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation:

\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5\]

Let me simplify this:

\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5\]

Combining like terms:

\[(2 + 1 + 2) + (3t - 4t + 12t) = 5\]

\[5 + (11t) = 5\]

So:

\[5 + 11t = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]

Therefore:

\[t = 0\]

Now that I have \(t = 0\), I can plug this back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 2 + 3(0) = 2 \\
y &= -1 + 4(0) = -1 \\
z &= 2 + 12(0) = 2
\end{align*}
\]

So, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Wait a minute, but let me verify if this point actually lies on the plane. Plugging \(x = 2\), \(y = -1\), and \(z = 2\) into the plane equation:

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Yes, it satisfies the plane equation. So, the point is indeed \((2, -1, 2)\).

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe without parametrizing the line. Perhaps using the symmetric equations directly.

Let me try that. The symmetric equations are:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k\]

Let me denote this common value as \(k\). So:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 2 + 3k \\
y &= -1 + 4k \\
z &= 2 + 12k
\end{align*}
\]

This is essentially the same as parametrizing, which is what I did earlier. So, it seems like parametrization is a straightforward way to solve this.

Alternatively, maybe I can solve the symmetric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other and then substitute into the plane equation. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, actually, the symmetric equations already give me expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(k\), which is what I need for substitution into the plane equation.

So, I think parametrization is the most efficient method here.

Just to be thorough, let me consider if there could be another point of intersection. Suppose there is another value of \(t\) that satisfies the plane equation. But from the equation \(5 + 11t = 5\), it's clear that \(t = 0\) is the only solution. So, there is only one point of intersection.

Also, I should check if the line is parallel to the plane or lies entirely within the plane. If the line were parallel to the plane, there would be no intersection, and if it lay within the plane, every point on the line would satisfy the plane equation.

To check this, I can see if the direction vector of the line is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane. The normal vector of the plane can be obtained from its equation \(x - y + z = 5\), which is \(\langle 1, -1, 1 \rangle\).

The direction vector of the line is \(\langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\).

To check if they are perpendicular, I can compute their dot product:

\[3(1) + 4(-1) + 12(1) = 3 - 4 + 12 = 11 \neq 0\]

Since the dot product is not zero, the direction vector is not perpendicular to the normal vector, meaning the line is not parallel to the plane. Therefore, there should be exactly one point of intersection, which is what I found.

Alternatively, if the direction vector were parallel to the plane, the line could lie entirely within the plane, but in this case, since the dot product is not zero, that's not the situation here.

Alternatively, I can check if the point \((2, -1, 2)\) lies on the plane, which I already did, and since it does, and the line is not parallel to the plane, this must be the only point of intersection.

Just to explore further, suppose I didn't parametrize the line. Is there another way to find the intersection point?

Let me try solving the symmetric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other and then substitute into the plane equation.

From the symmetric equations:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k\]

Let me set \(k = \frac{x - 2}{3}\), and \(k = \frac{y + 1}{4}\), and \(k = \frac{z - 2}{12}\).

So, I can express \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
\begin{align*}
k &= \frac{x - 2}{3} \\
y + 1 &= 4k = 4\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) \\
y &= 4\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) - 1 \\
z - 2 &= 12k = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) \\
z &= 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 \\
&= 4(x - 2) + 2 \\
&= 4x - 8 + 2 \\
&= 4x - 6
\end{align*}
\]

Now, substitute \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\) into the plane equation:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

Substitute:

\[x - \left(4\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) - 1\right) + (4x - 6) = 5\]

Let me simplify this:

\[x - \frac{4(x - 2)}{3} + 1 + 4x - 6 = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[x + 4x - \frac{4(x - 2)}{3} + 1 - 6 = 5\]

\[5x - \frac{4x - 8}{3} - 5 = 5\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

\[15x - (4x - 8) - 15 = 15\]

\[15x - 4x + 8 - 15 = 15\]

\[11x - 7 = 15\]

\[11x = 22\]

\[x = 2\]

Now, plug \(x = 2\) back into the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\):

\[y = 4\left(\frac{2 - 2}{3}\right) - 1 = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]

\[z = 4(2) - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2\]

So again, the point is \((2, -1, 2)\), which matches what I found earlier.

This confirms that my initial answer is correct.

I think that's thorough enough. I've verified the answer using two different methods, and both lead to the same conclusion.

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

First, we rewrite the equation of the line in parametric form:
\[x = 2 + 3t,\quad y = -1 + 4t,\quad z = 2 + 12t.\]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[3t - 4t + 12t = 5 - 2 + 1.\]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[11t = 4.\]

Dividing both sides by 11, we find:
\[t = \frac{4}{11}.\]

Now, we substitute this value of $t$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the point of intersection:
\[x = 2 + 3\left(\frac{4}{11}\right) = \frac{26}{11},\]
\[y = -1 + 4\left(\frac{4}{11}\right) = \frac{15}{11},\]
\[z = 2 + 12\left(\frac{4}{11}\right) = \frac{58}{11}.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{\left(\frac{26}{11}, \frac{15}{11}, \frac{58}{11}\right)}}.$

We can rewrite the equation of the line as a system of parametric equations:
\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.\]
Substituting these into the equation $x - y + z = 5,$ we get
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]
Simplifying, we have $11t + 5 = 5,$ so $t = 0.$
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the parametric equations, we find that the point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}.$

To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line and the plane.

First, let's rewrite the equation of the line in parametric form. We can set the common ratio to $t$:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.\]

From this, we can solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[11t + 5 = 5.\]

Solving for $t$, we find:
\[11t = 0.\]
\[t = 0.\]

Now, we can substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations to find the point of intersection:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$.

The final answer is (2, -1, 2).

To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we need to express the line in parametric form and then substitute the expressions for x, y, and z into the equation of the plane.

Step 1: Express the line in parametric form.
Let's denote the parameter as t. Then, we have:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = t \Rightarrow x = 3t + 2\]
\[\frac{y + 1}{4} = t \Rightarrow y = 4t - 1\]
\[\frac{z - 2}{12} = t \Rightarrow z = 12t + 2\]

Step 2: Substitute the expressions for x, y, and z into the equation of the plane.
The equation of the plane is given as:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

Substituting the expressions for x, y, and z, we get:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Step 3: Solve for t.
Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
\[11t + 5 = 5\]
\[11t = 0\]
\[t = 0\]

Step 4: Find the point of intersection by substituting t back into the parametric equations.

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}

To find the point of intersection of the line given by the symmetric equations

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

and the plane given by the equation

\[
x - y + z = 5,
\]

we start by parameterizing the line. Let

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.
\]

From this, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of the parameter \(t\):

\[
x - 2 = 3t \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3t + 2,
\]

\[
y + 1 = 4t \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 4t - 1,
\]

\[
z - 2 = 12t \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 12t + 2.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation:

\[
x - y + z = 5.
\]

Substituting, we have:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5.
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]

\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0.
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = 0.
\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parameterized equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]

\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,
\]

\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equation of the line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and the equation of the plane as $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing the equation of the line in parametric form to make it easier to work with.
Let's express $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t.$ From the equation of the line, we have $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t.$

## Step 3: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection.
Substituting $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5,$ we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$

## Step 4: Solve for $t$ in the resulting equation from step 3.
Simplifying the equation $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5,$ we get $5 + 11t = 5.$ Solving for $t,$ we find $t = 0.$

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $t$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t,$ we get $x = 2,$ $y = -1,$ and $z = 2.$

## Step 6: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equations $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing each equation in terms of a single variable, say $x$, to simplify the system.
From the first equation, we can express $y$ and $z$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = \frac{12}{3}(x - 2) = 4(x - 2)$.

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $y$ and $z$ into the second equation to get an equation in terms of $x$ only.
Substituting $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = 4(x - 2)$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get $x - \frac{4}{3}(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = 5$.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation to solve for $x$.
Expanding the equation gives $x - \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{8}{3} + 4x - 8 = 5$. Combining like terms yields $\frac{5}{3}x - 8 = 5$. Adding 8 to both sides gives $\frac{5}{3}x = 13$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{5}$ gives $x = 39/5$.

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $x$ back into the expressions for $y$ and $z$ to find their values.
Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ gives $y = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{15}$. Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $z = 4(x - 2)$ gives $z = 4(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = 4(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = 4(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{5}$.

## Step 6: The point of intersection is given by the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ found in the previous steps.
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

## Step 7: We can simplify the point of intersection by finding a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator for the fractions is 15. Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{3}, \frac{116}{15} \cdot \frac{1}{1}, \frac{116}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{117}{15}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{348}{15}\right)$.

The point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{348}{15}\right) = \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{29}{5}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

## Step 1:  To find the point of intersection between the given line and the plane, we first need to express the line in a more convenient form. The line is given by the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.$
## Step 2:  We can parameterize the line using the parameter $t$ as follows: $x = 2 + 3t, y = -1 + 4t, z = 2 + 12t.$ This parameterization allows us to express the coordinates of any point on the line in terms of $t$.
## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the point of intersection between this line and the plane $x - y + z = 5.$ To do this, we substitute the parameterized equations of the line into the equation of the plane.
## Step 4:  Substituting $x = 2 + 3t, y = -1 + 4t, z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5,$ we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$
## Step 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $5 + 11t = 5.$
## Step 6:  Solving for $t$, we find that $t = 0.$
## Step 7:  Now that we have the value of $t$, we can substitute it back into the parameterized equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
## Step 8:  Substituting $t = 0$ into the parameterized equations, we get $x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.$
## Step 9:  Therefore, the point of intersection between the line and the plane is $(2, -1, 2).$

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$

Here's how to find the point of intersection:

**1. Parameterize the line:**

The equation  \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]represents a line in parametric form.  We can write it as:

*  $x = 3t + 2$
*  $y = 4t - 1$
*  $z = 12t + 2$

where $t$ is a parameter.

**2. Substitute into the plane equation:**

Substitute these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:

$(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5$

**3. Solve for t:**

Simplify and solve the equation for $t$:

$3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5$
$11t + 5 = 5$
$11t = 0$
$t = 0$

**4. Find the point of intersection:**

Substitute the value of $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

* $x = 3(0) + 2 = 2$
* $y = 4(0) - 1 = -1$
* $z = 12(0) + 2 = 2$



**Final Answer:** $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

Here's how to find the point of intersection:

**1. Solve for x, y, and z in terms of a parameter**

From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$, we can solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of a parameter, say $t$.  Let's solve for $x$:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = t \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3t + 2.\]

Let's solve for $y$:
\[\frac{y + 1}{4} = t \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 4t - 1.\]

Let's solve for $z$:
\[\frac{z - 2}{12} = t \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 12t + 2.\]

**2. Substitute into the equation x - y + z = 5**

Substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

**3. Simplify and solve for t**

Simplify the equation and solve for $t$:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
\[11t + 5 = 5\]
\[11t = 0\]
\[t = 0\]

**4. Find the coordinates of the point of intersection**

Substitute $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]

1. **Find the parametric equations of the line:**
   Given the line equation:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]
   We can set:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = t, \quad \frac{y + 1}{4} = t, \quad \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]
   Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:
   \[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t\]

2. **Substitute into the plane equation:**
   The plane equation is given by:
   \[x - y + z = 5\]
   Substitute $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the plane equation:
   \[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5\]
   Simplify and solve for $t$:
   \[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5\]
   \[7 + 11t = 5\]
   \[11t = -2\]
   \[t = -\frac{2}{11}\]

3. **Find the point of intersection:**
   Substitute $t = -\frac{2}{11}$ back into the parametric equations:
   \[x = 2 + 3\left(-\frac{2}{11}\right) = 2 - \frac{6}{11} = \frac{16}{11}\]
   \[y = -1 + 4\left(-\frac{2}{11}\right) = -1 - \frac{8}{11} = -\frac{19}{11}\]
   \[z = 2 + 12\left(-\frac{2}{11}\right) = 2 - \frac{24}{11} = \frac{2}{11}\]

   Therefore, the point of intersection is:
   \[\boxed{\left(\frac{16}{11}, -\frac{19}{11}, \frac{2}{11}\right)}\]

To find the point of intersection of the given line and plane, we start by analyzing the given equations:

1. The line equation:
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

2. The plane equation:
\[
x - y + z = 5
\]

First, we express each component of the line equation in terms of a parameter $ t $:
\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation to find the parameter $ t $:
\[
3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5
\]
\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5
\]
\[
11t + 5 = 5
\]

Solving for $ t $:
\[
11t = 0 \implies t = 0
\]

Now, we substitute $ t = 0 $ back into the expressions for $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2
\]
\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1
\]
\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is:
\[
\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}
\]

To find the point of intersection of the line and the plane, we start by expressing the line in parametric form. Given the line equation:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

we can write the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:

\[
x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:

\[
(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5 + 11t = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0
\]

Solve for $t$:

\[
t = 0
\]

Now, substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\[
x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is:

\[
\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}

To find the point of intersection of the line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form. The given line equation is:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

Let's denote the common ratio by $t$. Then we have:
\[x - 2 = 3t, \quad y + 1 = 4t, \quad z - 2 = 12t.\]

Solving these equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$, we get:
\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.\]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $t$. Let's perform these calculations.
```python

 First, we can rewrite the parametric equations of the line as $x = 3t + 2$, $y = 4t - 1$, and $z = 12t + 2$.
Substituting these into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives $19t + 3 = 5$, so $19t = 2$ and $t = \frac{2}{19}$.
Substituting this value of $t$ into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we find
\[x = 3\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) + 2 = \frac{6}{19} + 2 = \frac{6 + 38}{19} = \frac{44}{19},\]
\[y = 4\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{8}{19} - 1 = \frac{8 - 19}{19} = -\frac{11}{19},\]
and
\[z = 12\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) + 2 = \frac{24}{19} + 2 = \frac{24 + 38}{19} = \frac{62}{19}.\]
So the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{44}{19}, -\frac{11}{19}, \frac{62}{19}\right)$. The answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{44}{19}, -\frac{11}{19}, \frac{62}{19}\right)}$

To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute this into the equation of the plane to solve for the parameter.

The line is given by:
$$\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$$

This can be rewritten in parametric form as:
$$x = 3t + 2$$
$$y = 4t - 1$$
$$z = 12t + 2$$

where $t$ is a parameter.

The equation of the plane is:
$$x - y + z = 5$$

Substituting the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane gives:
$$(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5$$
$$11t + 5 = 5$$
$$11t = 0$$
$$t = 0$$

Now, we substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the point of intersection:
$$x = 3(0) + 2 = 2$$
$$y = 4(0) - 1 = -1$$
$$z = 12(0) + 2 = 2$$

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.
The final answer is \boxed{(2,-1,2)}

 The line is given by the parametric equations
\[x = 3t + 2,\] \[y = 4t - 1,\] and \[z = 12t + 2.\] We substitute these into the equation of the plane to get
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\] Simplifying, we have
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\] which simplifies further to
\[11t + 5 = 5.\] Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us
\[11t = 0,\] so $t = 0.$ Substituting this back into the parametric equations for the line, we find that the point of intersection is
\[(x, y, z) = (2, -1, 2).\] Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}.$

 From the equation, $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4},$ $4x - 8 = 3y + 3,$ so $4x - 3y = 11.$

Also, $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{z - 2}{12},$ so $4x - 8 = 3z - 6,$ and $4x - 3z = -2.$

Thus, the line is parameterized by
\begin{align*}
x &= t + 2, \\
y &= \frac{4t - 11}{3}, \\
z &= \frac{4t + 2}{3}.
\end{align*}We substitute into $x - y + z = 5,$ to get
\[t + 2 - \frac{4t - 11}{3} + \frac{4t + 2}{3} = 5.\]Solving, we find $t = 1.$  Hence, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(3, -3, 6)}.$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The given line can be rewritten as a system of equations:
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{x - 2}{3} &= t, \\
\frac{y + 1}{4} &= t, \\
\frac{z - 2}{12} &= t.
\end{aligned}\]Solving each equation for $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we get
\[\begin{aligned}
x &= 2 + 3t, \\
y &= -1 - 4t, \\
z &= 2 + 12t.
\end{aligned}\]We substitute these expressions for $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 - 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]Simplifying the left-hand side, we get
\[2 + 3t + 1 + 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]or $2 + 1 + 2 + 3t + 4t + 12t = 5.$  Combining like terms, we have
\[19t + 5 = 5,\]or $19t = 0.$  Therefore, $t = 0.$

Substituting $t = 0$ into the equations for $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we get
\[\begin{aligned}
x &= 2 + 3(0) = 2, \\
y &= -1 - 4(0) = -1, \\
z &= 2 + 12(0) = 2.
\end{aligned}\]Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2).$ The answer is: $(2,-1,2)$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I have this problem here. I need to find the point where a line intersects with a plane. The line is given by the equation:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

And the plane is given by:

\[
x - y + z = 5
\]

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The first one looks like the symmetric form of a line in 3D space. It has direction ratios: 3 for x, 4 for y, and 12 for z. So, the parametric equations can be written as:

\[
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t \\
z = 2 + 12t
\]

Where t is a parameter.

The second equation is that of a plane. To find their intersection, I need to substitute the parametric equations of the line into the plane's equation and solve for t.

Substituting:

\[
(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5
\]

Let me simplify this:

\[
2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5 \\
(2 + 1 + 2) + (3t - 4t + 12t) = 5 \\
5 + 11t = 5
\]

Now, solving for t:

\[
11t = 5 - 5 \\
11t = 0 \\
t = 0
\]

Okay, so t equals 0. Now, plug t back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

For x:

\[
x = 2 + 3(0) = 2
\]

For y:

\[
y = -1 + 4(0) = -1
\]

For z:

\[
z = 2 + 12(0) = 2
\]

So, the point should be (2, -1, 2).

But wait, let me verify if this point satisfies both equations.

First, check the line equation:

\[
\frac{2 - 2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = \frac{2 - 2}{12} \\
\frac{0}{3} = \frac{0}{4} = \frac{0}{12} \\
0 = 0 = 0
\]

That checks out.

Now, check the plane equation:

\[
2 - (-1) + 2 = 5 \\
2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \\
5 = 5
\]

Perfect, it satisfies the plane equation.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using vectors or matrices?

Well, since it's a line intersecting a plane, the solution should be unique unless they are parallel or something, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

Wait, just to be thorough, let's consider if the line is parallel to the plane. If the direction vector of the line is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane, then they don't intersect.

The direction vector of the line is <3, 4, 12>, and the normal vector of the plane is <1, -1, 1>.

Their dot product is:

\[
3*1 + 4*(-1) + 12*1 = 3 - 4 + 12 = 11
\]

Since the dot product is not zero, the line is not parallel to the plane, so they must intersect at exactly one point.

Therefore, my earlier calculation should be correct.

Just to double-check, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane or something, but that might be overkill.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the system of equations differently.

Let me try expressing y in terms of x from the plane equation and substituting into the line equation.

From the plane equation:

\[
x - y + z = 5 \\
-y = 5 - x - z \\
y = x + z - 5
\]

Now, substitute this expression for y into the line equation.

But the line equation is already in parametric form, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the line in Cartesian form.

Given the direction ratios, the general equation would be:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

Then,

\[
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t \\
z = 2 + 12t
\]

Which is what I had before.

Substituting into the plane equation led me to t=0, giving the point (2,-1,2), which satisfies both equations.

I think that's solid.

Maybe I can also consider the parametric equations and see if there's another way to parameterize them.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors, the position vector of any point on the line plus a scalar multiple of the direction vector gives points on the line.

But again, that leads back to the same parametric equations.

I think I've confirmed enough that the intersection point is indeed (2,-1,2).

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form by setting \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these expressions into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation**:
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5 \implies 11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0 \implies t = 0.
   \]

4. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

5. **Write the final answer**:
   The point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).
