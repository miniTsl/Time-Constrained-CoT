1. Linear Equations in Three Variables: A system of linear equations in three variables can be solved using the elimination method, substitution method, or matrix method.
2. Slope-Intercept Form of a Line: A line in three dimensions can be represented by three equations, each representing one of the variables in terms of the other two.

**Reasoning**
First, let's rewrite the given line equation in three variables:

1) x - 2 = 3z - 3y
2) y + 1 = 4(z - 2)/3
3) z - 2 = 12(x - 2)/3

We can eliminate one variable at a time. Let's start with z:

From equation 3, we can express z in terms of x and y:
z = (3x - 9)/12 + 2

Substitute this expression for z into equation 1:
x - 2 = 3((3x - 9)/12 + 2) - 3(y + 1)

Simplify and solve for x:
x = 9/4 + 3y/4 + 2
x = (9 + 3y + 24)/4

Now, substitute this expression for x into equation 2:
y + 1 = 4((9 + 3y + 24)/4 - 2)/3

Simplify and solve for y:
3y + 4 = 9 + 3y + 24
3y = 33
y = 11

Substitute y back into the expression for x:
x = (9 + 3(11) + 24)/4
x = 26/4
x = 6.5

Substitute x and y back into the original equation x - y + z = 5:
6.5 - 11 + z = 5
z = 22.5

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection is \boxed{(6.5, 11, 22.5)}.

- The line is given in symmetric form, which can be converted to parametric form.
- The equation of the line can be written as:
  \[
  \frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t
  \]
- Substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$ to find the intersection point.

   \]
2. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5
   \]
   \[
   5 + 11t = 5
   \]
3. Solve for $t$:
   \[
   11t = 0 \implies t = 0
   \]
4. Substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
   \[
   x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2

- Parametric form of a line equation.
- Substitution method to solve simultaneous equations.
- Point of intersection between a line and a plane.

**Reasoning**
The given line can be written in parametric form. Let's denote the parameter as $t$. Then, we have:
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]
From this, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:
\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
\]

We need to find the point where this line intersects the plane $x - y + z = 5$. Substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the plane equation:
\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5
\]
\[
11t + 5 = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
11t = 0
\]
Thus,
\[
t = 0
\]

Now substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2
\]
\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1
\]
\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

To find the point of intersection between a line and a plane, we need to parameterize the line and substitute the parameterized coordinates into the equation of the plane. The line is given in symmetric form, which can be converted to parametric form.

**Reasoning**
The symmetric form of the line is:
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]
where \(t\) is a parameter. From this, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):
\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation \(x - y + z = 5\):
\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,
\]
\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]
\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

Solving for \(t\):
\[
11t + 5 = 5,
\]
\[
11t = 0,
\]
\[
t = 0.
\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]
\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,
\]
\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

To find the point of intersection of a given line with a plane, we can use the parametric form of the line equation. The line is given in symmetric form, which can be converted into parametric form. We will then substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation to solve for the parameter. Finally, we will substitute the value of the parameter back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

**Reasoning**

1. **Convert the symmetric form to parametric form:**
   The given line is:
   \[
   \frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
   \]
   This can be written as the parametric equations:
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
   \]

2. **Substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation:**
   The plane equation is:
   \[
   x - y + z = 5
   \]
   Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
   \]
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   (3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5
   \]
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point:**
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations:
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2
   \]
   \[
   y = 4(0) - 1 = -1
