Prime numbers ending in 3 are of the form 3, 7, or any number of the form 6n + 3 (where n is an integer). Since we're looking for primes less than 100, we can check 3, 7, and the numbers 3, 13, 19, 23, 29, 37, 43, 49, 53, 59, 63, 67, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. We can quickly eliminate 49, 63, and 81 (multiples of 3), and 49 and 97 (since they are not prime). So, there are 14 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Fine Reasoning**
First, let's understand the structure of prime numbers ending in 3. They are of the form 6n + 3, where n is an integer. To find the prime numbers less than 100, we need to find the values of n for which 6n + 3 is prime and 6n + 3 is less than 100.

We can start by checking the smallest possible value of n, which is 0 (giving us 3), and then increment n by 1 until we find a non-prime number or reach a value of n that makes 6n + 3 greater than 100.

Starting from n = 0, we have:
- 3 (prime)
- 7 (prime)
- 11 (not prime)
- 15 (not prime)
- 19 (prime)
- 23 (prime)
- 27 (not prime)
- 31 (prime)
- 35 (not prime)
- 37 (prime)
- 41 (prime)
- 45 (not prime)
- 49 (not prime)
- 53 (prime)
- 57 (not prime)
- 59 (prime)
- 61 (prime)
- 65 (not prime)
- 67 (prime)
- 71 (prime)
- 73 (prime)
- 75 (not prime)
- 77 (not prime)
- 79 (prime)
- 81 (not prime, since it's a multiple of 3)
- 83 (prime)
- 85 (not prime)
- 87 (not prime)
- 89 (prime)
- 91 (not prime)
- 93 (not prime)

So, there are 14 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Coarse Reasoning**

So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Okay, first things first, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from 2 upwards, let's list them out:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, I need to pick out those that end with a 3. Looking at the list:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

That's seven numbers. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Wait a minute, is there a smarter way to do this without listing all primes? Maybe there's a pattern or something.

Well, prime numbers can end with 1, 3, 7, or 9, except for 2 and 5. So, focusing on those ending with 3, maybe there's a formula or something that can help me count them directly.

But since 100 isn't too big, listing them out seems straightforward and less error-prone for now.

**Fine Reasoning**

Alright, let's approach this more methodically. I need to find all prime numbers less than 100 that end with a 3.

First, let's list all numbers less than 100 that end with a 3:

3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.

Now, I need to check which of these are prime.

Starting with 3:

- 3 is a prime number (only divisors are 1 and 3).

Next, 13:

- 13 is prime (divisors are 1 and 13).

Then, 23:

- 23 is prime.

Now, 33:

- 33 is divisible by 3 and 11, so it's not prime.

Next, 43:

- 43 is prime.

Then, 53:

- 53 is prime.

Next, 63:

- 63 is divisible by 3 and 21, so not prime.

Then, 73:

- 73 is prime.

Next, 83:

- 83 is prime.

Finally, 93:

- 93 is divisible by 3 and 31, so not prime.

So, from the list, the prime numbers are:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's a total of 7 prime numbers.

Is there a way to generalize this or find a pattern?

Well, numbers ending with 3 are of the form 10k + 3, where k is an integer from 0 to 9 in this case, since we're considering numbers less than 100.

So, for k from 0 to 9, the numbers are:

10*0 + 3 = 3

10*1 + 3 = 13

10*2 + 3 = 23

10*3 + 3 = 33

10*4 + 3 = 43

10*5 + 3 = 53

10*6 + 3 = 63

10*7 + 3 = 73

10*8 + 3 = 83

10*9 + 3 = 93

Out of these, as we've checked, the primes are those where 10k + 3 is only divisible by 1 and itself.

So, for k=0: 3 (prime)

k=1: 13 (prime)

k=2: 23 (prime)

k=3: 33 (not prime)

k=4: 43 (prime)

k=5: 53 (prime)

k=6: 63 (not prime)

k=7: 73 (prime)

k=8: 83 (prime)

k=9: 93 (not prime)

So, primes are for k=0,1,2,4,5,7,8.

That's seven values of k that make 10k + 3 a prime number under 100.

Is there a pattern in these k values? Let's see:

k=0,1,2,4,5,7,8

Looking at these, there doesn't seem to be an immediate arithmetic pattern, but perhaps in terms of their properties.

For example, none of these k values are divisible by 3, except k=0.

Wait, k=3 is 33, which is not prime, and k=6 is 63 (not prime), k=9 is 93 (not prime). So, for k divisible by 3 (k=3,6,9), 10k + 3 is divisible by 3 and hence not prime (except for k=0, which is 3, which is prime).

So, a rule of thumb: for k divisible by 3 and k > 0, 10k + 3 is divisible by 3 and hence not prime.

But for other k values, we need to check individually.

For example, k=5: 53 is prime.

k=7:73 is prime.

k=8:83 is prime.

k=1:13 is prime.

k=2:23 is prime.

k=4:43 is prime.

So, excluding k=3,6,9, all others up to k=9 seem to be prime except for k=3,6,9.

But actually, k=0 is included, which is 3, which is prime.

So, in summary, for k from 0 to 9, excluding k=3,6,9, the rest are prime.

But wait, k=0 is included as 3, which is prime.

So, perhaps a general approach is:

- For numbers of the form 10k + 3, where k is an integer, and the number is less than 100 (so k from 0 to 9),

- Exclude cases where k is divisible by 3 and k > 0.

- Then, check the remaining k values to see if 10k + 3 is prime.

But in this specific case, since n < 100, k only goes up to 9, so it's manageable to list them out.

Alternatively, since 10k + 3 being divisible by any prime other than 2 or 5 (as it already ends with 3), we need to check divisibility by primes like 3,7,11, etc.

But given the small range, listing and checking seems efficient.

So, to confirm, the prime numbers less than 100 ending with 3 are:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's seven numbers.

Is there any chance I missed one?

Let's double-check the list:

- 3: prime

- 13: prime

- 23: prime

- 33: not prime (11*3)

- 43: prime

- 53: prime

- 63: not prime (7*9)

- 73: prime

- 83: prime

- 93: not prime (31*3)

Yes, only seven primes ending with 3 below 100.

So, the answer should be 7.

To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, but we only need to consider numbers ending in 3. We start with the list of numbers from 3 to 93, with a step of 10 (i.e., 3, 13, 23, ..., 93). We know that 3 is a prime number, so we keep it. For the remaining numbers, we can eliminate any number that is divisible by 3, as it will not be prime. This leaves us with the numbers 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

To solve this problem, we need to identify all prime numbers less than 100 and then count how many of these have a units digit of 3. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The units digit of a number is simply the last digit of that number. We can list the prime numbers less than 100 and check their units digits to find those ending in 3.

**Fine Reasoning**

1. **List all prime numbers less than 100:**
   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2, and continue listing primes.
   - The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

2. **Identify primes with a units digit of 3:**
   - Check each prime number from the list to see if its units digit is 3.
   - The numbers with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

3. **Count these numbers:**
   - There are 7 prime numbers with a units digit of 3.

Thus, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is 7.

**Coarse Reasoning**
We can start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 and checking their units digits. However, this approach is inefficient. A more efficient approach is to realize that prime numbers greater than 3 can only end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. We can then count the number of prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3.

**Fine Reasoning**
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1.  We know that prime numbers greater than 3 can only end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.
2.  We can start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
3.  We can count the number of prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3: there are 7 prime numbers that meet this condition.
4.  Therefore, the answer is 7.

Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.  We need to check numbers ending in 3 less than 100 and see if they fit this rule.  There aren't many to check, so this should be doable.

**Fine Reasoning**

Here are the numbers less than 100 that end in 3:

3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93

Let's check each for primality:

* 3 is prime
* 13 is prime
* 23 is prime
* 33 is divisible by 3, so not prime
* 43 is prime
* 53 is prime
* 63 is divisible by 3, so not prime
* 73 is prime
* 83 is prime
* 93 is divisible by 3, so not prime

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and the possible units digits of prime numbers.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The units digit of a prime number can only be 1, 3, 7, or 9, as these are the only digits that, when multiplied by any other digit, result in a number that is not divisible by any other digit except 1 and itself.

**Fine Reasoning**
To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can systematically check each number from 1 to 99. We will exclude numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, as these are not prime numbers. This will help us identify the prime numbers that end in 3.

1. **Prime numbers ending in 3**: The only prime number ending in 3 is 3 itself.
2. **Prime numbers ending in 7**: The prime numbers ending in 7 are 7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97.
3. **Prime numbers ending in 9**: The prime numbers ending in 9 are 19, 29, 59, 79, 89.

Combining these, the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3, 7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97, 19, 29, 59, 79, and 89.

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-20b
To solve this problem, we need to identify prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

**Coarse Reasoning:**
- Prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. These are the only numbers less than 100 that end with 3 and are prime.

**Fine Reasoning:**
- We can systematically check each number less than 100 that ends with 3 to see if it is prime. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
- Starting from 3 and moving up, we check each number:
 - 3 is prime.
 - 13 is prime.
 - 23 is prime.
 - 33 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 11).
 - 43 is prime.
 - 53 is prime.
 - 63 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 21).
 - 73 is prime.
 - 83 is prime.
 - 93 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 31).

**Final Answer:**
There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The numbers are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
The final answer is 7

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-7b
To solve this problem, we need to identify all prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. These are the prime numbers that meet the criteria of having a units digit of 3 and being less than 100. 

To ensure these numbers are prime, we can quickly check their divisibility by smaller primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) to confirm they are not divisible by any of these, which would disqualify them from being prime. However, given the nature of these numbers, it's clear they are not even, nor do they end in 5, so they are not divisible by 2 or 5. The only other concern would be divisibility by 3 and 7, but these are not necessary to check individually for each number since we are looking for prime numbers. The fact that they are all less than 100 and do not have 2 or 5 as a factor (the only prime factors of 10) already confirms their primality.

Therefore, the prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. 

Counting these, we find there are 7 such prime numbers.

 **Coarse Reasoning**
The prime numbers less than 100 that end with a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 such numbers.

**Fine Reasoning**
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 100 that end with a units digit of 3 are:

- 3 (since it is the only prime number that ends with 3)
- 13 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 13)
- 23 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 23)
- 43 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 43)
- 53 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 53)
- 73 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 73)
- 83 (since it has no divisors other than 1 and 83)

So, there are 7 such numbers.

**Final Answer**
There are $\boxed{7}$ prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So there are 7 such numbers.

**Fine Reasoning**
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are:

- 3 (since it has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 3)
- 13 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 13)
- 23 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 23)
- 43 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 43)
- 53 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 53)
- 73 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 73)
- 83 (only two positive divisors: 1 and 83)

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

**Final Answer**
The number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is 7. The answer is: $\boxed{7}$.

Alright, so I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 end with the digit 3. Okay, first things first, I should probably list all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones have a units digit of 3.

Let me start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from the smallest:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Okay, that's all of them. Now, I need to look at their units digits and see if they're 3.

Looking at the list:

- 3: ends with 3

- 13: ends with 3

- 37: ends with 7 (not 3)

- 43: ends with 3

- 63: wait, 63 is not in my list because it's not prime. Let me check again.

Wait, actually, 63 is not prime; it's divisible by 3 and 21. So, skipping that.

So, from the primes listed, the ones ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 43.

Is there any other prime less than 100 that ends with 3?

Let me double-check the list:

- 3: yes

- 13: yes

- 23: yes

- 43: yes

- 53: no

- 73: yes

- 83: yes

- 97: no

So, the primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 73, 83.

That's six primes.

Wait a minute, but earlier I thought only three had units digit 3. But now I've found six. Maybe I missed some.

Let me count them again:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 73

- 83

Yes, that's six.

But let me make sure none of these are missing.

Starting over:

Primes less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, filtering for those ending with 3:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 73

- 83

No others seem to fit.

So, there are six such primes.

But wait, is there a smarter way to do this without listing all primes less than 100?

I mean, maybe using properties of numbers or something.

Well, since we're dealing with primes less than 100, and specifically looking for those ending with 3, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can help us directly calculate the number without listing all primes.

However, given time constraints, especially since this seems like a problem that might be part of a larger set requiring efficiency, perhaps sticking to the initial approach is best.

Alternatively, I could consider that any number ending with 3 must be odd (since even numbers ending with 3 aren't possible), and then check divisibility by 3, but that might complicate things more.

Given that, I think the straightforward approach of listing primes and checking their units digit is efficient enough for this range.

Therefore, the answer should be six.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{6} \]

### Problem: How many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3?

### Coarse Reasoning
To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all prime numbers less than 100.
2. Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3.

### Fine Reasoning
Let's start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, we will filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3:
- 3
- 13
- 23
- 43
- 53
- 73
- 83

Let's count these numbers:
There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

### Final Answer
\boxed{7}
