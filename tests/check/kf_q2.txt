1. Linear Equations in Three Variables: A system of linear equations in three variables can be solved using the elimination method, substitution method, or matrix method.
2. Slope-Intercept Form of a Line: A line in three dimensions can be represented by three equations, each representing one of the variables in terms of the other two.

**Reasoning**
First, let's rewrite the given line equation in three variables:

1) x - 2 = 3z - 3y
2) y + 1 = 4(z - 2)/3
3) z - 2 = 12(x - 2)/3

We can eliminate one variable at a time. Let's start with z:

From equation 3, we can express z in terms of x and y:
z = (3x - 9)/12 + 2

Substitute this expression for z into equation 1:
x - 2 = 3((3x - 9)/12 + 2) - 3(y + 1)

Simplify and solve for x:
x = 9/4 + 3y/4 + 2
x = (9 + 3y + 24)/4

Now, substitute this expression for x into equation 2:
y + 1 = 4((9 + 3y + 24)/4 - 2)/3

Simplify and solve for y:
3y + 4 = 9 + 3y + 24
3y = 33
y = 11

Substitute y back into the expression for x:
x = (9 + 3(11) + 24)/4
x = 26/4
x = 6.5

Substitute x and y back into the original equation x - y + z = 5:
6.5 - 11 + z = 5
z = 22.5

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection is \boxed{(6.5, 11, 22.5)}.

**Reasoning**

The equation of the line is given as
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.
\]
Let's denote this common ratio by \( t \). Then we can express \( x, y, \) and \( z \) in terms of \( t \):
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = t \implies x = 3t + 2,
\]
\[
\frac{y + 1}{4} = t \implies y = 4t - 1,
\]
\[
\frac{z - 2}{12} = t \implies z = 12t + 2.
\]

We need to find the point where this line intersects the plane given by the equation \( x - y + z = 5 \). Substitute the expressions for \( x, y, \) and \( z \) into the plane equation:
\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,
\]
\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]
\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
11t = 0 \implies t = 0.
\]

Now substitute \( t = 0 \) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]
\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,

To find the point of intersection between the given line and the plane, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Parametric Equations of the Line

The parametric equations of a line in 3D space can be written as:
\[ x = x_0 + at \]
\[ y = y_0 + bt \]
\[ z = z_0 + ct \]

Given the symmetric form of the line equation:
\[ \frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t \]

We identify \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 12\) from the symmetry. The points on the line are:
\[ (x_0, y_0, z_0) = (2, -1, 2) \]

Thus, the parametric equations become:
\[ x = 2 + 3t \]
\[ y = -1 + 4t \]
\[ z = 2 + 12t \]

### Step 2: Substitute into the Plane Equation

Next, substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation \(x - y + z = 5\):
\[ (2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5 \]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[ 2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5 \]
\[ 5 + 11t = 5 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \(t\)

Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ 11t = 0 \]

Divide by 11:
\[ t = 0 \]

### Step 4: Find Intersection Point

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:
\[ x = 2 + 3(0) = 2 \]
\[ y = -1 + 4(0) = -1 \]
\[ z = 2 + 12(0) = 2 \]

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.

Simplifying the left side, we get:

So I have this problem here. I need to find the point where a given line intersects with a plane. The line is given in a parametric form, and the plane is given by an equation. Let me see how to approach this.

First, the line is given by:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

And the plane is:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

I remember that when equations are presented like this for a line, it's called the symmetric form. It's a way to express the direction ratios of the line. So, the direction ratios here are 3, 4, and 12 for x, y, and z respectively, and the point (2, -1, 2) lies on the line.

I think the best way to find the intersection is to parametrize the line and then substitute into the plane equation to solve for the parameter.

Let me parametrize the line. Let’s set:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

So, then:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

Now, since this point lies on the plane, it must satisfy the plane's equation:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

Substituting the parametric equations into the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me simplify this:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combining like terms:

\[(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5\]\[(11t) + 5 = 5\]

So:

\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]

Therefore:

\[t = 0\]

Now, plug t back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

Wait a minute, but let's verify if this point actually lies on the plane.

Plug in x=2, y=-1, z=2 into the plane equation:

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Yes, it satisfies the plane equation. So, the point is correct.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

1. Equation of a line in symmetric form: The given line is in symmetric form, which is \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

2. Parametric form of a line: We can convert the symmetric form to parametric form by setting each fraction equal to a parameter, say \(t\):
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]

3. Equation of a plane: The given plane is \(x - y + z = 5\).

4. Substitution method: To find the intersection point, we substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane.

**Reasoning:**

Step 1: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane.

\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]

Step 2: Simplify the equation.

\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]
\[5 + 11t = 5.\]

\[11t = 0,\]
\[t = 0.\]

Step 4: Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations of the line to find the intersection point.

\[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2,\]
\[y = -1 + 4(0) = -1,\]
\[z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]

To find the point of intersection of the line given by the symmetric equations

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

and the plane given by the equation

\[
x - y + z = 5,
\]

we can proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Parameterize the Line

The symmetric equations of the line can be parameterized by introducing a parameter \( t \). We have:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = t, \quad \frac{y + 1}{4} = t, \quad \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.
\]

From these, we can express \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) in terms of \( t \):

\[
x = 3t + 2,
\]
\[
y = 4t - 1,
\]
\[
z = 12t + 2.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the Plane Equation

Substitute these parameterized expressions into the plane equation \( x - y + z = 5 \):

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5.
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]

\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( t \)

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0.
\]

Thus, 

\[
t = 0.
\]

### Step 4: Find the Intersection Point

Substitute \( t = 0 \) back into the parameterized equations for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \):

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]
\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,
\]
\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we first need to express the given line in a more manageable form.
We can rewrite the given line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t,$ where $t$ is a parameter.

## Step 2: Express x, y, and z in terms of t.
From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = t,$ we get $x = 3t + 2.$ From $\frac{y + 1}{4} = t,$ we get $y = 4t - 1.$ From $\frac{z - 2}{12} = t,$ we get $z = 12t + 2.$

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for x, y, and z into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$ to find the value of t.
Substituting $x = 3t + 2,$ $y = 4t - 1,$ and $z = 12t + 2$ into the equation of the plane, we get $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.$

## Step 4: Solve for t.
Simplifying the equation $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5,$ we get $11t + 5 = 5.$ Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get $11t = 0.$ Dividing both sides by 11, we get $t = 0.$

## Step 5: Substitute the value of t back into the expressions for x, y, and z to find the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into $x = 3t + 2,$ we get $x = 3(0) + 2 = 2.$ Substituting $t = 0$ into $y = 4t - 1,$ we get $y = 4(0) - 1 = -1.$ Substituting $t = 0$ into $z = 12t + 2,$ we get $z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.$

## Step 6: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

<<< checkpoint: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equations $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing each equation in terms of a single variable, say $x$, to simplify the system.
From the first equation, we can express $y$ and $z$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = \frac{12}{3}(x - 2) = 4(x - 2)$.

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $y$ and $z$ into the second equation to get an equation in terms of $x$ only.
Substituting $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = 4(x - 2)$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get $x - \frac{4}{3}(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = 5$.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation to solve for $x$.
Expanding the equation gives $x - \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{8}{3} + 4x - 8 = 5$. Combining like terms yields $\frac{5}{3}x - 8 = 5$. Adding 8 to both sides gives $\frac{5}{3}x = 13$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{5}$ gives $x = 39/5$.

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $x$ back into the expressions for $y$ and $z$ to find their values.
Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ gives $y = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{15}$. Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $z = 4(x - 2)$ gives $z = 4(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = 4(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = 4(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{5}$.

## Step 6: The point of intersection is given by the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ found in the previous steps.
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

## Step 7: The final answer is the point of intersection.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right)}$

Step 1:  To find the point of intersection between the given line and the plane, we first need to express the line in a more convenient form. The line is given in the symmetric form as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.$ This means that the line passes through the point $(2,-1,2)$ and has direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}.$
Step 2:  We can parameterize the line using the point and the direction vector. Let $t$ be a parameter, then the line can be expressed as $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\ -1 + 4t \\ 2 + 12t \end{pmatrix}.$
Step 3:  Now, we need to find the point of intersection of this line with the plane $x - y + z = 5.$ To do this, we substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane.
Step 4:  Substituting $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5,$ we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$
Step 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $5 + 11t = 5.$ Solving for $t,$ we find $t = 0.$
Step 6:  Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line, we get the point of intersection as $(2, -1, 2).$
Step 7:  Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the plane is $\boxed{\left( 2, \  -1, \  2\right)}.$

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  -1, \  2\right)}$

* **Parameterization of a line:** A line can be parameterized by a vector equation of the form  
   \[ \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t \mathbf{v},\]where $\mathbf{r}_0$ is a point on the line and $\mathbf{v}$ is a direction vector.
* **Solving systems of equations:** We can solve a system of equations by substitution, elimination, or other methods.
* **Geometric interpretation of parametric equations:**  The intersection of two lines is the point where the lines intersect.

**Reasoning**

1. **Parameterize the line:**  We can find the direction vector of the line by looking at the coefficients of the variables in the equation.  The direction vector is $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}$.  We can also find a point on the line by setting $t = 0$ in the parameterization.  Let's call this point $\mathbf{r}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.  So, the line can be parameterized as:
   \[\mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}.\]

2. **Substitute into the second equation:** We can substitute the parametric equation of the line into the equation $x - y + z = 5$.  This gives us:
   \[2 - y + 2 + t(3) = 5.\]

3. **Solve for y:**  Solving for $y$, we get:
   \[y = 1 - 3t.\]

4. **Substitute to find z:**  We can substitute this value of $y$ into the parametric equation of the line to find $z$ in terms of $t$.  This gives us:
   \[z = 2 + 12t.\]

5. **Find the intersection point:**  We can now find the point of intersection by setting $y = 1 - 3t$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ equal to each other.  This gives us a single equation in terms of $t$.  Solving for $t$, we get:
   \[t = \frac{1 - z}{3}.\]

6. **Substitute to find x:**  Substituting this value of $t$ back into the parametric equation of the line, we can find the value of $x$.  This gives us the coordinates of the intersection point.

**Final Answer**

We can simplify the process by substituting the value of $t$ into the equation for $y$ and $z$ to get the coordinates of the intersection point.

To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first need to express the line in parametric form. The given line is given by the equation:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

Let's start by expressing $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t$:
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]

Let's simplify and solve for $t$:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]
\[9t + 5 = 5,\]
\[9t = 0,\]
\[t = 0.\]

Now that we have $t = 0$, we can find the coordinates of the point of intersection by substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations of the line:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-20b
To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute this into the equation of the plane to solve for the parameter.

The given line is:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

This can be rewritten in parametric form as:
\[x = 3t + 2\]
\[y = 4t - 1\]
\[z = 12t + 2\]

The equation of the plane is:
\[x - y + z = 5\]

Substituting the parametric forms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation gives:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
\[11t + 5 = 5\]
\[11t = 0\]
\[t = 0\]

Substituting \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-7b
To find the point of intersection of the given line and plane, we first express the line in a parametric form. The line is given by
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]
Let's denote the common parameter by $t$. Thus, we can write the parametric equations of the line as
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$ to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection. Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives us
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]

Let's solve this equation for $t$ using Python.

 The given line can be rewritten in the parametric form as
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 - 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]
We substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane to get
\[2 + 3t - (-1 - 4t) + 2 + 12t = 5.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[3t + 4t + 12t = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\]
Combining like terms, we get
\[19t = 4,\]
so $t = \frac{4}{19}.$
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the parametric equations, we find
\[x = 2 + 3 \cdot \frac{4}{19} = \frac{38}{19} = 2,\]
\[y = -1 - 4 \cdot \frac{4}{19} = \frac{-19}{19} = -1,\]
\[z = 2 + 12 \cdot \frac{4}{19} = \frac{50}{19}.\]
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{\left(2, -1, \frac{50}{19}\right)}.$
The answer is $\boxed{(2,-1,\frac{50}{19})}$.

 The given line can be rewritten as a system of equations:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = t, \quad \frac{y + 1}{4} = t, \quad \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.\]
Solving each equation for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 - 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]
We substitute these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 - 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[2 + 3t + 1 + 4t + 2 + 12t = 5.\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[19t + 5 = 5.\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[19t = 0.\]
Dividing both sides by 19 gives:
\[t = 0.\]
Substituting $t = 0$ back into the equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives:
\[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 - 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]
So the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$. The answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

So I have this problem here: find the point of intersection of the line given by \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The first equation is parametrically describing a line in 3D space. It looks like it's in symmetric form, where each variable is divided by its coefficient equals some common parameter, which we can call \(t\). So, if I set \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = t\), then \(\frac{y + 1}{4} = t\), and \(\frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). That means I can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

So, any point on this line can be written as \((3t + 2, 4t - 1, 12t + 2)\).

The second equation is a plane in 3D space defined by \(x - y + z = 5\). To find their intersection, I need to find the values of \(t\) for which the point \((3t + 2, 4t - 1, 12t + 2)\) lies on the plane. That means plugging these expressions into the plane equation should satisfy it:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me simplify that:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]\[(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5\]\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]\[t = 0\]

Okay, so \(t = 0\) is the value that satisfies both the line and the plane equations. Now, plug \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point should be \((2, -1, 2)\).

Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Expanding the negative sign:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combining like terms:

\(3t - 4t + 12t = (3 - 4 + 12)t = 11t\)

And \(2 + 1 + 2 = 5\), so indeed:

\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives \(11t = 0\), so \(t = 0\). Plugging back in:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Just to be thorough, maybe I can verify this by substituting the point back into both equations to ensure it satisfies them.

First, check the line equation:

\[\frac{2 - 2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = \frac{2 - 2}{12}\]\[\frac{0}{3} = \frac{0}{4} = \frac{0}{12}\]\[0 = 0 = 0\]

That checks out.

Now, check the plane equation:

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Perfect, it matches the plane equation.

I think that's solid. No errors in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form by setting \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 11t + 5.
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0.
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

The point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).
