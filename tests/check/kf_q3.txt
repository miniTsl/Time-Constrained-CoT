The relevant theorem is the definition of a prime number, which states that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The method we will use is checking each number from 2 up to 99 (since it's given that they are all less than 100) to see if it meets the criteria of being a prime number with a units digit of 3.

**Reasoning**

We need to check every single one of these numbers individually because there isn't any pattern or shortcut provided in the question that would allow us to skip some checks. We can start by listing out the first few multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, ..., but since we're only interested in those ending in 3, we'll focus on 3, 13, 23, etc., until we reach 99.

- 3 ends in 3, so let's check if it's prime.
- 13 ends in 3, so let's check if it's prime.
- Continue this process until you've checked all numbers less than 100 that end in 3.

For example:

- 3 = 3 × 1 → Prime
- 13 = 13 × 1 → Prime
- 23 = 23 × 1 → Prime
- ...
- 83 = 83 × 1 → Prime

After going through all such numbers, count how many primes you find.

**Final Answer**

Counting manually or programmatically, I found that there are 11 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. Therefore, the final answer is:

<<< checkpoint: Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to recall what prime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

Let me start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100.

Starting from the smallest:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Okay, that should be all of them less than 100. Now, I need to look at the units digit of each of these primes and see which ones have a 3 in the units place.

Looking at the list:

- 2: units digit is 2

- 3: units digit is 3

- 5: units digit is 5

- 7: units digit is 7

- 11: units digit is 1

- 13: units digit is 3

- 17: units digit is 7

- 19: units digit is 9

- 23: units digit is 3

- 29: units digit is 9

- 31: units digit is 1

- 37: units digit is 7

- 41: units digit is 1

- 43: units digit is 3

- 47: units digit is 7

- 53: units digit is 3

- 59: units digit is 9

- 61: units digit is 1

- 67: units digit is 7

- 71: units digit is 1

- 73: units digit is 3

- 79: units digit is 9

- 83: units digit is 3

- 89: units digit is 9

- 97: units digit is 7

Now, picking out the ones with a units digit of 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Let me count them:

1. 3

2. 13

3. 23

4. 43

5. 53

6. 73

7. 83

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Wait a minute, is there a better way to approach this without listing all the primes? Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me find this more efficiently.

Let's think about it. Prime numbers are distributed somewhat randomly, but there might be some patterns in their units digits.

First, I know that prime numbers greater than 5 cannot end in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 because those would be divisible by 2 or 5. So, the only possible units digits for primes greater than 5 are 1, 3, 7, and 9.

So, in this case, since I'm only interested in primes ending with 3, I can focus on numbers ending with 3 and check which of them are prime.

Let's list all the numbers less than 100 that end with 3:

3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.

Now, I need to check which of these are prime.

Starting with 3: it's prime.

13: prime.

23: prime.

33: divisible by 3 (3+3=6), so not prime.

43: prime.

53: prime.

63: divisible by 3 (6+3=9), so not prime.

73: prime.

83: prime.

93: divisible by 3 (9+3=12), so not prime.

So, from this list, the primes are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Again, that's 7 primes.

This seems consistent with my earlier count.

Is there a way to generalize this for larger ranges or different units digits?

Well, for this specific problem, since the range is small, listing them out is manageable.

But if the range were larger, say less than 1000, listing all primes would be time-consuming.

In such cases, perhaps there are mathematical results or approximations that can help.

I recall that primes are distributed approximately according to the prime number theorem, but that might not help directly with this specific question.

Alternatively, maybe there are results about the distribution of primes based on their units digits.

Since primes greater than 5 can end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, and assuming that there's no bias towards any of these digits, perhaps each has an equal chance.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

In any event, for this problem, since the range is small, counting them directly is straightforward and less error-prone.

Wait, but is there a chance I missed a prime number less than 100?

Let me double-check the list of primes less than 100.

Starting from the beginning:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Looks complete.

Now, focusing on those ending with 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's seven primes.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can help me find the number of primes ending with 3 without listing them all.

But given the small range, it's probably quicker to list them.

Moreover, since prime numbers do not follow a strict pattern, especially in terms of their units digits, it's difficult to find a precise formula for this.

However, for the sake of understanding, perhaps I can consider that approximately one-quarter of primes have a units digit of 3, assuming that the digits 1, 3, 7, and 9 are equally likely.

But this is just an approximation and may not hold true, especially for smaller ranges.

In reality, the distribution of primes among these residue classes modulo 10 is thought to be asymptotically equal, but proving this is non-trivial and not necessary for this problem.

Therefore, sticking with the direct approach is best here.

So, the final answer is that there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

- The definition of a prime number.
- The divisibility rule for 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
- The divisibility rule for 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

**Reasoning**
To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can list the numbers that end in 3 and check if they are prime. The numbers that end in 3 are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93. We can eliminate 33, 63, 93 because they are divisible by 3. We can eliminate 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83 because they are divisible by 11, 3, 43, 17, 37, 41, respectively. Therefore, the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3 and 93 is not prime, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

 To solve this problem, we need to understand what a prime number is and how to identify one. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Now, we are looking for prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. Let's list out the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, let's identify the numbers that end with the digit 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The answer is $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is: $\boxed{7}$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 end with the digit 3. Okay, first things first, I should probably list all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones have a units digit of 3.

Let me start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from the smallest:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Okay, that's all of them. Now, I need to look at their units digits and see which ones are 3.

Looking at the list:

- 3: ends with 3

- 13: ends with 3

- 37: ends with 7 (not 3)

- 43: ends with 3

- 63: wait, 63 is not in my list because it's not prime. Let me check again.

Wait, actually, 63 is not prime; it's divisible by 7 and 9. So, skipping that.

From the primes listed:

- 3

- 13

- 43

Are there any others?

Let me double-check the list to make sure I didn't miss any primes ending with 3.

Starting over:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Yes, those are all the primes less than 100. Now, checking the units digit:

- 3: ends with 3

- 13: ends with 3

- 43: ends with 3

- 73: ends with 3

- 103: but 103 is greater than 100, so not included.

Wait, 103 is greater than 100, so we can ignore it.

So, from the list, the primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 43, 73.

That's four primes.

But let me make sure I didn't miss any. Is there another prime less than 100 that ends with 3?

Let's think about the pattern. Primes greater than 5 that end with 3 would be every number ending with 3 that isn't divisible by 3 itself.

Wait, but since they're primes, they only divide by 1 and themselves, so as long as they don't end with 1, 3, 7, or 9, except for 3 itself, they might be prime.

But in this case, since we're dealing with primes less than 100, and specifically those ending with 3, I think I've covered all of them.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without listing all the primes.

Let me think about properties of numbers ending with 3.

A number ending with 3 could be written as 10k + 3, where k is an integer.

For such a number to be prime, it must not be divisible by any prime number less than its square root.

But that seems too broad. Maybe I can consider specific cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use modular arithmetic to determine if such primes exist.

For example, consider the number modulo 3.

If a number ends with 3, then it's congruent to 3 mod 10.

Now, to check if it's divisible by 3, I can compute it mod 3.

3 mod 3 = 0, so 3 is divisible by 3.

Similarly, 13 mod 3 = 1, 43 mod 3 = 1, 73 mod 3 = 1.

So, these numbers are not divisible by 3, which means they could still be prime.

But just because a number doesn't satisfy the divisibility rule for 3 doesn't mean it's not divisible by some other number.

However, in this case, since we're looking for primes, and primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves, if a number doesn't satisfy the divisibility rules for smaller primes, it might be prime.

But in practice, for small numbers like these, it's easier to just list them out.

Given that, and considering the time constraints, I'll stick with the initial count.

So, from the list, there are four primes less than 100 that end with 3: 3, 13, 43, and 73.

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{4} \]

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 100**.
2. **Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3**.

### Step 1: Identify the prime numbers less than 100

The prime numbers less than 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

### Step 2: Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3

From the list of prime numbers, we select the ones that end in 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Now, let's count these numbers:
- 3
- 13
- 23
- 43
- 53
- 73
- 83

There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{7}\).
