To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we can consider that any number ending in 3 must be odd. Since all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime, and the only even prime is 2, we need to check if there are any other primes ending in 3. The candidate primes would be 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. We will verify these one by one.

   \[
   3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93
   \]

2. **Check each number to see if it is prime:**
   - **3**: The only divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. Therefore, 3 is prime.
   - **13**: The only divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. Therefore, 13 is prime.
   - **23**: The only divisors of 23 are 1 and 23. Therefore, 23 is prime.
   - **33**: The divisors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, and 33. Therefore, 33 is not prime.
   - **43**: The only divisors of 43 are 1 and 43. Therefore, 43 is prime.
   - **53**: The only divisors of 53 are 1 and 53. Therefore, 53 is prime.
   - **63**: The divisors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63. Therefore, 63 is not prime.
   - **73**: The only divisors of 73 are 1 and 73. Therefore, 73 is prime.
   - **83**: The only divisors of 83 are 1 and 83. Therefore, 83 is prime.
   - **93**: The divisors of 93 are 1, 3, 31, and 93. Therefore, 93 is not prime.

3. **Count the prime numbers:**
   The prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3 are:
   \[
   3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83
   \]
   There are 7 such prime numbers.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{7}\).

<<< checkpoint: Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. And the units digit is the last digit of the number.

First, I should list all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3. That sounds straightforward. Let's list the primes under 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, I'll pick out the ones that end with a 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Let's see, is that all of them? Let me check again.

3, 13, 23, 33... wait, 33 isn't prime, it's 3 times 11. So skip that.

Then 43, which is prime.

53, prime.

63? 63 is 9 times 7, not prime.

73, prime.

83, prime.

93? 93 is 3 times 31, not prime.

So the primes less than 100 ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's 7 primes.

Wait a minute, is 3 actually considered? It's a prime, and its units digit is 3, but it's a single-digit number. Does that count? I think so, since the problem says less than 100, and 3 is less than 100.

So, total of 7.

But maybe I missed one? Let's count again.

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. That's 7.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this without listing all primes. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me find how many primes under 100 end with 3.

Well, prime numbers greater than 5 that end with 3 would be of the form 10k + 3, where k is a positive integer. But I'm not sure if that helps me count them directly.

Alternatively, I know that primes can end with 1, 3, 7, or 9, except for 2 and 5. So, focusing on those ending with 3, I can look for numbers ending with 3 and check their primality.

But perhaps listing them is the simplest way for numbers less than 100.

Alternatively, I could consider that for a number to be prime and end with 3, it must not be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. So, for each number ending with 3 below 100, I can check its divisibility.

But that seems more time-consuming than just listing the primes.

Wait, maybe I can list all numbers less than 100 that end with 3 and then check which ones are prime.

Numbers less than 100 ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.

Now, check which of these are prime:

- 3: prime

- 13: prime

- 23: prime

- 33: not prime (11*3)

- 43: prime

- 53: prime

- 63: not prime (9*7)

- 73: prime

- 83: prime

- 93: not prime (3*31)

So, again, the primes are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. Total of 7.

Wait, but is there a possibility I missed a number? Let's see, numbers less than 100 ending with 3: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93. That's all of them.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider negative numbers, but primes are defined as positive integers greater than 1, so negatives don't count.

Also, 1 is not a prime number, so it's excluded.

Therefore, the answer should be 7.

But to be thorough, let's confirm if any of the numbers I excluded are actually prime.

- 33: divisible by 3 and 11

- 63: divisible by 3, 7, 9

- 93: divisible by 3 and 31

Yes, they're all composite.

So, final answer is 7.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the distribution of primes ending with 3.

But for the purpose of this problem, since the numbers are small, listing them is sufficient.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is 7.

**Quick Answer:** There are 10 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Verification:**
To verify this, we need to list all prime numbers less than 100 and count those that end in 3. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Let's list the prime numbers less than 100:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, we filter out the primes that end in 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

Counting these, we find there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Final Answer:** There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-7b
To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 100**: We need to list all prime numbers less than 100.
2. **Filter the prime numbers with a units digit of 3**: From the list of prime numbers, we will identify those that end with the digit 3.

Let's start with step 1:

Prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, let's move to step 2:

From the list above, the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Thus, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The final answer is \(\boxed{7}\).

 To solve this problem, we need to find all the prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. 

Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Now, let's look at these numbers and find the ones that end with the digit 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The answer is $\boxed{7}$.

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
To solve this problem, I need to find how many prime numbers less than 100 end with the digit 3. Let's approach this step by step.

First, I should list all the prime numbers less than 100 and then check which ones have a units digit of 3. Alternatively, since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe there's a smarter way to count them without listing all primes.

Let's start by recalling that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to consider all primes below 100 and see if their units digit is 3.

One way to do this is to list all primes less than 100 and pick those that end with 3. But that might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or property related to the units digit that can help us here.

I know that for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. However, since we're dealing with primes (which are only divisible by 1 and themselves), having a units digit of 3 doesn't necessarily mean the number is divisible by 3, but it does tell us something about the possible endings of such primes.

Wait, actually, any prime number greater than 3 must not be divisible by 3. If a prime ends with 3, it could still not be divisible by 3, depending on the entire number. For example, 13 is a prime ending with 3 and is not divisible by 3.

But perhaps focusing on the units digit isn't directly helpful here. Maybe I should just list the primes less than 100 and see which ones end with 3.

Let me list all primes less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, from this list, let's identify which primes end with 3:

13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

So, these are the primes less than 100 that end with 3.

Counting them: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. That's six primes.

Wait, but is there a possibility of more primes ending with 3 that I might have missed? Let's double-check the list.

Looking back at the list of primes less than 100:

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

Yes, that seems complete. No other primes in this range end with 3.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical reason why there are exactly six such primes. Let's think about the properties of primes ending with 3.

A number ending with 3 cannot be divisible by 3, as per the divisibility rule for 3. Since primes greater than 3 cannot be divisible by any number other than 1 and themselves, having a units digit of 3 is acceptable for primes.

Moreover, primes ending with 3 are part of a specific sequence. In fact, primes ending with 3 occur periodically among all primes.

Given that, and considering the density of primes decreases as numbers get larger, it makes sense that there are relatively few primes ending with 3 below 100.

Therefore, my initial count of six primes seems accurate.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{6} \]

**Quick Answer**
To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we can list them out and count them. Let's start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 and then identify those with a units digit of 3.

**Verification**
Let's list the prime numbers less than 100:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, let's identify the prime numbers with a units digit of 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

We can see that there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

**Final Answer**
The number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{7}\).
