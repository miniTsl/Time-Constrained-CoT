To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can first list the numbers from 3 to 99 and then check which of them are prime.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Now, let's filter the list from 3 to 99 that have a units digit of 3:

3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93

Now, we check which of these numbers are prime:

3 (yes, it's a prime number)
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 29, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 67, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 (these are the prime numbers from the list)

So, there are \boxed{15} prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Final Answer** \boxed{15}

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we need to identify all such primes and count them.

First, let's list the prime numbers less than 100:
\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\]

Next, we filter these primes to find those that end in 3:
- \(3\) (prime)
- \(37\) (prime)

We can see that there are no other primes ending in 3 among the first few hundred natural numbers. To ensure completeness, we should verify if any larger primes could end in 3 but are not included in our initial list. However, since the problem specifies primes less than 100, we do not need to consider primes greater than 97.

Thus, the only prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3 are 3 and 37. Therefore, there are exactly two such primes.

So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's start by understanding what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

First, I should list all the prime numbers less than 100. I know that 2 is the first prime number, and it's the only even prime number. Then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. I think that's all of them, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any.

Let me list them again:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

I'll check if there are any primes less than 100 that I might have missed. Starting from 2 up to 97, and making sure none are missing. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. I think that's all of them. There are 25 prime numbers less than 100.

Now, I need to see which of these have a units digit of 3. So, looking at the list:

- 3 (units digit 3)

- 13 (units digit 3)

- 23 (units digit 3)

- 43 (units digit 3)

- 53 (units digit 3)

- 73 (units digit 3)

- 83 (units digit 3)

Let's see, are there any others? Let's check the list again to make sure.

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

I don't see any other primes less than 100 that end with a 3. So, there are 7 such primes.

Wait a minute, is 3 itself considered? Yes, it is a prime number less than 100 and its units digit is 3. So, it should be included.

Let me just confirm if all these numbers are indeed prime:

- 3: prime

- 13: prime

- 23: prime

- 43: prime

- 53: prime

- 73: prime

- 83: prime

Yes, all of these are prime numbers.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is 7.

Step 4:  The numbers less than 100 that end in 3 are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93.
Step 5:  We can eliminate 3, 33, and 93 because they are divisible by 3, which means they are not prime numbers.
Step 6:  Next, we need to check the remaining numbers to see if they are prime.
Step 7:  13 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 8:  23 is also a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 9:  43 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 10:  53 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 11:  63 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 21.
Step 12:  73 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 13:  83 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 14:  Therefore, the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
Step 15:  So, the total number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is $\boxed{6}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we first list all the prime numbers less than 100. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 100 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Next, we identify which of these numbers have a units digit of 3:

- 3
- 13
- 23
- 43
- 53
- 73

These are the prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. Counting these, we find there are 6 such numbers.

Thus, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{6}\).

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we need to identify all prime numbers in this range and then filter those that end in the digit 3.

First, let's list all prime numbers less than 100:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Next, we filter out the primes that have a units digit of 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

Counting these, we find there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Thus, the number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{7}\).

To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then identify which ones end in 3.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, we need to identify which of these prime numbers have a units digit of 3. They are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is $\boxed{7}$.

 To solve this problem, we need to understand what a prime number is and how to identify one. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

We are asked to find the prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. Let's list out the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, let's identify the numbers that end with the digit 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The answer is $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is: $7$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

First, I'll list all the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Okay, now I need to identify which of these primes end with a 3. Looking at the list:

- 3

- 13

- 31 (ends with 1)

- 43

- 63 (not prime)

Wait, 31 ends with 1, not 3. So it's not included. Let me check again.

Actually, in my initial list, 3 is the only one that ends with 3. But wait, 13 does too. And 43, but 43 is greater than 100, so it doesn't count anyway since we're only considering primes less than 100.

Let me double-check: 3, 13, 43. Among these, 3 and 13 are primes, but 43 is greater than 100, so it's excluded.

So, from the list, only 3 and 13 satisfy the condition of having a units digit of 3 and being less than 100.

But wait, is there any other prime number less than 100 that ends with 3 besides 3 and 13?

Let me think about this differently. Maybe there's a pattern or something I'm missing.

I know that for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Also, if a number ends with 3, it might have some properties related to divisibility.

But in this case, since we're dealing with primes less than 100, maybe it's better to just list them out as I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible units digits for prime numbers. Primes greater than 5 cannot end with 5 because they would be divisible by 5. Similarly, they cannot end with even digits except for 2, but 2 is already accounted for.

So, primes can end with 1, 3, 7, or 9.

Therefore, among primes less than 100, those ending with 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

Now, let's verify each one:

- 3: prime

- 13: prime

- 23: prime

- 43: prime

- 53: prime

- 73: prime

- 83: prime

All of these are indeed primes.

So, there are 7 such primes.

Wait a minute, earlier I thought only 3 and 13 were primes, but clearly, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83 are also primes.

So, the total is 7.

But let me make sure I didn't miss any.

Listing them again:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's seven primes.

Is there any other prime less than 100 that ends with 3 that I might have missed?

Let's see:

- 3: yes

- 13: yes

- 23: yes

- 43: yes

- 53: yes

- 73: yes

- 83: yes

No others seem to fit.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is 7.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{7} \]
