To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations simultaneously.

First, let's rearrange the given line equation into the standard form Ax - By + Cz = D:

1. Multiply the first equation by 4, the second equation by 3, and the third equation by 1, and then add them together:

4*(x - 2) + 3*(y + 1) + 12*(z - 2) = 0

2. Simplify and rearrange:

4x - 8 + 3y + 3 + 12z - 24 = 0

3. Rearrange into the standard form:

x - y + z = \boxed{14}

Now, we have found one equation of the line of intersection. However, we still need to find the value of x, y, and z that satisfy the second equation, x - y + z = 5.

4. Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation found in step 3:

x - y + z - 14 = -9

5. Rearrange into the standard form for a linear equation:

x - y + z = \boxed{5 + 14} = \boxed{19}

Since the two equations for the line of intersection are x - y + z = 14 and x - y + z = 19, they are inconsistent, meaning there is no point of intersection for the given line and the plane.

Therefore, the point of intersection is undefined or does not exist.

1. **Express the line in parametric form**:
   The given line can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t
   \]

2. **Substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation**:
   Substitute $x = 2 + 3t$, $y = -1 + 4t$, and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:
   \[
   (2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation**:
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   5 + 11t = 5
   \]

4. **Solve for $t$**:
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0
   \]
   Divide by 11:
   \[
   t = 0
   \]

5. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations:
   \[
   x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2
   \]

 First, we express each variable in terms of a common parameter $t$:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.\]
Thus, we have:
\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.\]

Next, substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane:
\[x - y + z = 5.\]
Substituting the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]
Simplify and solve for $t$:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]
\[11t + 5 = 5,\]
\[11t = 0,\]
\[t = 0.\]

Now, substitute $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

 First, let's denote the common ratio as $k$. So we have:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k\]

From this, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $k$:

\[x = 3k + 2\]
\[y = 4k - 1\]
\[z = 12k + 2\]

Now, substitute these expressions into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:

\[(3k + 2) - (4k - 1) + (12k + 2) = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3k + 2 - 4k + 1 + 12k + 2 = 5\]
\[11k + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11k = 0\]

Divide both sides by 11:

\[k = 0\]

Now, substitute $k = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.

The final answer is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$.

So I have this problem here: I need to find the point where a given line intersects with a plane. The line is given by the symmetric equations \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\), and the plane is given by the equation \(x - y + z = 5\).

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The symmetric equations of the line tell me that the direction ratios of the line are 3, 4, and 12 for x, y, and z respectively, and it passes through the point (2, -1, 2). The plane equation is in the standard form ax + by + cz = d.

To find the point of intersection, I need to find a point that lies on both the line and the plane. That means the coordinates of the point must satisfy both the line's equations and the plane's equation.

One way to approach this is to parametrize the line. Since the symmetric equations are equal to a common parameter, say \(t\), I can write:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

From this, I can express x, y, and z in terms of \(t\):

\[
x = 3t + 2
\]

\[
y = 4t - 1
\]

\[
z = 12t + 2
\]

Now, since the point lies on the plane, its coordinates must satisfy the plane's equation \(x - y + z = 5\). So, I can substitute the expressions for x, y, and z in terms of \(t\) into the plane's equation:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Let me simplify this:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5
\]

\[
(11t) + 5 = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0
\]

So, \(t = 0\).

Now that I have \(t = 0\), I can plug this value back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2
\]

\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1
\]

\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

Wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if this point indeed lies on both the line and the plane.

First, check if it lies on the line. Plugging x = 2, y = -1, z = 2 into the symmetric equations:

\[
\frac{2 - 2}{3} = 0, \quad \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = 0, \quad \frac{2 - 2}{12} = 0
\]

So, all parts equal 0, which means they are equal, so the point lies on the line.

Now, check if it lies on the plane:

\[
2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
\]

Yes, it satisfies the plane's equation.

So, the point of intersection is indeed (2, -1, 2).

But, I'm a bit suspicious because the calculations were too straightforward. Maybe there's a mistake somewhere.

Let me re-examine the parametric equations. Starting from:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

Then:

\[
x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2
\]

Substituting into the plane equation:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5
\]

Simplify:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5
\]

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5
\]

\[
11t + 5 = 5
\]

\[
11t = 0 \implies t = 0
\]

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, like using vectors or something, but I think parametrizing the line and substituting into the plane equation is a standard method.

Alternatively, I could consider the direction vector of the line and the normal vector of the plane to see if they are perpendicular or not. The direction vector of the line is \(\vec{d} = \langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\), and the normal vector of the plane is \(\vec{n} = \langle 1, -1, 1 \rangle\).

The dot product is:

\[
3(1) + 4(-1) + 12(1) = 3 - 4 + 12 = 11 \neq 0
\]

Since the dot product is not zero, the line is not parallel to the plane, which means it must intersect the plane at exactly one point. So, my earlier result makes sense.

Alternatively, if the line were parallel to the plane, the dot product would be zero, and either there would be no intersection or the line would lie entirely on the plane. But in this case, since the dot product is 11, which is not zero, the line intersects the plane at exactly one point, which is what I found: (2, -1, 2).

Just to be thorough, maybe I can try another method. Let's solve the symmetric equations for x, y, and z in terms of each other.

From \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4}\), cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) \implies 4x - 8 = 3y + 3 \implies 4x - 3y = 11
\]

From \(\frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\), cross-multiplying gives:

\[
12(y + 1) = 4(z - 2) \implies 12y + 12 = 4z - 8 \implies 12y - 4z = -20 \implies 3y - z = -5
\]

So now I have two equations:

1. \(4x - 3y = 11\)

2. \(3y - z = -5\)

And the plane equation:

3. \(x - y + z = 5\)

Now, I can solve this system of three equations with three variables.

From equation 1: \(4x - 3y = 11\), so \(4x = 3y + 11 \implies x = \frac{3y + 11}{4}\)

From equation 2: \(3y - z = -5 \implies z = 3y + 5\)

Substitute x and z into equation 3:

\[
\frac{3y + 11}{4} - y + (3y + 5) = 5
\]

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

\[
3y + 11 - 4y + 12y + 20 = 20
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(3y - 4y + 12y) + (11 + 20) = 20
\]

\[
11y + 31 = 20
\]

\[
11y = -11 \implies y = -1
\]

Now, plug y = -1 back into the expressions for x and z:

\[
x = \frac{3(-1) + 11}{4} = \frac{-3 + 11}{4} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
\]

\[
z = 3(-1) + 5 = -3 + 5 = 2
\]

So again, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

This matches my earlier result, so I can be confident that this is the correct answer.

Alternatively, if I consider the line in vector form, the position vector of any point on the line can be written as:

\[
\vec{r} = \vec{a} + t\vec{b}
\]

where \(\vec{a} = \langle 2, -1, 2 \rangle\) is a point on the line, and \(\vec{b} = \langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\) is the direction vector.

The plane can be written as:

\[
\vec{r} \cdot \vec{n} = d
\]

where \(\vec{n} = \langle 1, -1, 1 \rangle\) is the normal vector, and d = 5.

Substituting the line equation into the plane equation:

\[
(\vec{a} + t\vec{b}) \cdot \vec{n} = d
\]

\[
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{n} + t(\vec{b} \cdot \vec{n}) = d
\]

Calculate \(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{n}\):

\[
2(1) + (-1)(-1) + 2(1) = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
\]

Calculate \(\vec{b} \cdot \vec{n}\):

\[
3(1) + 4(-1) + 12(1) = 3 - 4 + 12 = 11
\]

So:

\[
5 + 11t = 5 \implies 11t = 0 \implies t = 0
\]

Then, the position vector is:

\[
\vec{r} = \langle 2, -1, 2 \rangle + 0 \cdot \langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle = \langle 2, -1, 2 \rangle
\]

Again, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

I've now used three different methods to confirm the same answer. It seems solid.

Just to be absolutely sure, let's plug the point back into both the line and the plane equations.

First, the line:

\[
\frac{2 - 2}{3} = 0, \quad \frac{-1 + 1}{4} = 0, \quad \frac{2 - 2}{12} = 0
\]

All parts equal 0, so the point lies on the line.

Second, the plane:

\[
2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
\]

Which matches the plane equation.

Therefore, the point of intersection is indeed (2, -1, 2).

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

We can rewrite the equation of the line as
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t,\]where $t$ is a parameter.
Then $x = 3t + 2,$ $y = 4t - 1,$ and $z = 12t + 2.$
Substituting into $x - y + z = 5,$ we get
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]This simplifies to $11t + 3 = 5,$ so $t = \frac{2}{11}.$
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the equations for $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we find that the point of intersection is $\left( \frac{19}{11}, \frac{17}{11}, \frac{31}{11} \right).$
Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\left( \frac{19}{11}, \frac{17}{11}, \frac{31}{11} \right)}.The answer is: (\frac{19}{11},\frac{17}{11},\frac{31}{11})

To find the point of intersection of the line given by the symmetric equations

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

and the plane given by the equation

\[
x - y + z = 5,
\]

we start by parameterizing the line. Let

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.
\]

From this, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of the parameter \(t\):

\[
x - 2 = 3t \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3t + 2,
\]

\[
y + 1 = 4t \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 4t - 1,
\]

\[
z - 2 = 12t \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 12t + 2.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation:

\[
x - y + z = 5.
\]

Substituting, we have:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5.
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]

\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0.
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = 0.
\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parameterized equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]

\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,
\]

\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equation of the line in the form $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and the equation of the plane as $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can express the equation of the line in parametric form to make it easier to work with.
Let's express $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t.$ From the equation of the line, we have $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t.$

## Step 3: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection.
Substituting $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5,$ we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$

## Step 4: Solve for $t$ in the resulting equation from step 3.
Simplifying the equation $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5,$ we get $5 + 11t = 5.$ Solving for $t,$ we find $t = 0.$

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $t$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t,$ we get $x = 2,$ $y = -1,$ and $z = 2.$

## Step 6: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the line given by the equations $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and the plane given by the equation $x - y + z = 5$.

## Step 2: We can start by expressing the equation of the line in terms of a single variable, say $x$, to simplify the system.
From the equation of the line, we can express $y$ and $z$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = \frac{12}{3}(x - 2) = 4(x - 2)$.

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $y$ and $z$ into the equation of the plane to get an equation in terms of $x$ only.
Substituting $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = 4(x - 2)$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$, we get $x - \frac{4}{3}(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = 5$.

## Step 4: Simplify the resulting equation to solve for $x$.
Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $x - \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{8}{3} + 4x - 8 = 5$, which simplifies to $\frac{5}{3}x - 8 = 5$.

## Step 5: Solve for $x$.
Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get $\frac{5}{3}x = 13$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{5}$, we find $x = \frac{39}{5}$.

## Step 6: Substitute the value of $x$ back into the expressions for $y$ and $z$ to find their values.
Substituting $x = \frac{39}{5}$ into $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$, we get $y = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{15}$. Substituting $x = \frac{39}{5}$ into $z = 4(x - 2)$, we get $z = 4(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = 4(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = 4(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{5}$.

## Step 7: The point of intersection is given by the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ found in the previous steps.
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

## Step 8: Simplify the point of intersection to its simplest form.
The point of intersection can be simplified to $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right) = \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{29}{5}, \frac{29}{5}\right)$.

## Step 9: Write the point of intersection in the required format.
The point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{29}{5}, \frac{29}{5}\right)$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{29}{5}, \frac{29}{5}\right)}$

## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection with the plane $x - y + z = 5$.
## Step 4:  Substituting the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane, we get $3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5$.
## Step 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $11t + 5 = 5$, which gives us $11t = 0$.

To find the point of intersection of the given lines, we start by analyzing the equations of the lines:

1. $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$

2. $x - y + z = 5$

First, we simplify the first line equation. Let:
$$
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k
$$
for some constant $k$. Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $k$:
$$
x - 2 = 3k \implies x = 3k + 2
$$
$$
y + 1 = 4k \implies y = 4k - 1
$$
$$
z - 2 = 12k \implies z = 12k + 2
$$

Next, substitute these expressions into the second equation $x - y + z = 5$:
$$
(3k + 2) - (4k - 1) + (12k + 2) = 5
$$
Simplify the left-hand side:
$$
3k + 2 - 4k + 1 + 12k + 2 = 5
$$
Combine like terms:
$$
3k - 4k + 12k + 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
$$
$$
13k + 5 = 5
$$
Subtract 5 from both sides:
$$
13k = 0 \implies k = 0
$$

Thus, the point of intersection is when $k = 0$. Substituting $k = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
$$
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2
$$
$$
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1
$$
$$
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2
$$

Therefore, the point of intersection is:

From the parametric equations, we have:
$$
x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t
$$

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:

Simplify the left-hand side:

Combine like terms:
$$
5 + 11t = 5

Subtract 5 from both sides:
$$
11t = 0

Solve for $t$:
$$
t = 0

To find the point of intersection of the line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form. The given line equation is
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]
Let's denote the common ratio by $t$. Then we have
\[x - 2 = 3t, \quad y + 1 = 4t, \quad z - 2 = 12t.\]
Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$, we get
\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]
which simplifies further to
\[11t + 5 = 5.\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives
\[11t = 0,\]
so $t = 0$.

Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

Simplifying the left side gives $19t + 3 = 5$, so $19t = 2$ and $t = \frac{2}{19}$.
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the parametric equations, we find the point of intersection:
\[x = 3\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) + 2 = \frac{6}{19} + 2 = \frac{6 + 38}{19} = \frac{44}{19},\]

 First, we can rewrite the equation of the line in parametric form. From $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$, we have
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]Now substitute these expressions into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]Simplifying the left side gives
\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]which simplifies further to
\[5 + 11t = 5.\]Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $11t = 0$, so $t = 0$. Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives
\[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$. The answer is: \[\boxed{(2,-1,2)}\]

 First, we can rewrite the line equation as a parametric equation:
\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.\]
Now, substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]
which simplifies further to:
\[11t + 5 = 5.\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[11t = 0,\]
so $t = 0$.
Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives:
\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]
So the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$. The answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

 From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4},$ $4x - 8 = 3y + 3,$ so $4x - 3y = 11.$

From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{z - 2}{12},$ $12x - 24 = 3z - 6,$ so $4x - z = 18.$

Thus, the line is parameterized by
\begin{align*}
x &= t + 2, \\
y &= \frac{4t - 11}{3}, \\
z &= 4t + 18.
\end{align*}Substituting into $x - y + z = 5,$ we get
\[t + 2 - \frac{4t - 11}{3} + 4t + 18 = 5.\]Solving, we find $t = -2.$  Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(0,-9,10)}.$

 The given line can be rewritten as a system of equations:
\[\begin{aligned} \frac{x - 2}{3} &= t, \\ \frac{y + 1}{4} &= t, \\ \frac{z - 2}{12} &= t. \end{aligned}\]Solving for $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in terms of $t,$ we get
\[\begin{aligned} x &= 2 + 3t, \\ y &= -1 - 4t, \\ z &= 2 + 12t. \end{aligned}\]We substitute these into the equation of the plane to get
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 - 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]Simplifying, we have
\[2 + 3t + 1 + 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]or $19t = 0,$ so $t = 0.$
Substituting this back into the equations for $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we get
\[\begin{aligned} x &= 2 + 3(0) = 2, \\ y &= -1 - 4(0) = -1, \\ z &= 2 + 12(0) = 2. \end{aligned}\]Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2,-1,2).$ The answer is: $(2,-1,2)$

So I have this problem here: find the point of intersection of the line given by

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The first equation is that of a line in space, and the second is a plane. The point of intersection should be a point that lies on both the line and the plane, so it satisfies both equations simultaneously.

The line is given in parametric form, where each coordinate x, y, z is expressed as a function of a parameter, usually t. So, from the first equation:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

This means:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

where t is a parameter.

Now, since this line lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), any point (x, y, z) on the line must satisfy this equation. So, plugging in the expressions for x, y, z in terms of t into the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me simplify this:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]\[(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5\]\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]\[t = 0\]

Okay, so when t = 0, we get the point of intersection. Let's plug t = 0 back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

So, the point should be (2, -1, 2).

But wait, let me double-check if this point actually lies on both the line and the plane.

First, check if it's on the line. Plugging x=2, y=-1, z=2 into the parametric equations:

From x = 3t + 2:

\[2 = 3t + 2 \implies 3t = 0 \implies t = 0\]

From y = 4t - 1:

\[-1 = 4(0) - 1 \implies -1 = -1\]

From z = 12t + 2:

\[2 = 12(0) + 2 \implies 2 = 2\]

All checks out; it satisfies the line's parametric equations with t=0.

Now, check if it lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\):

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Yes, it does satisfy the plane's equation.

Therefore, the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

I think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I could have solved the system of equations directly. We have two equations:

1. \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\)

2. \(x - y + z = 5\)

Since the first equation represents a line, and the second is a plane, their intersection should be a single point, which makes sense because a line intersecting a plane generally gives one point unless they are parallel or coincident.

Another way to solve this is to express two variables in terms of the third using the line's parametric equations and then substitute into the plane equation to solve for the parameter.

For example, from the line's parametric equations:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

We can solve for t from one equation and substitute into the others, but that might be more complicated than necessary.

Alternatively, since all three coordinates are expressed in terms of t, perhaps I can eliminate t between the parametric equations and the plane equation, but I already did that earlier.

Wait, actually, I already found t=0, leading to the point (2,-1,2), and verified it satisfies both equations. So, I think that's solid.

Just to explore further, suppose I didn't want to use parameters. Maybe I can write the line in vector form.

The direction vector of the line is <3,4,12>, and a point on the line is (2,-1,2). So, the vector equation of the line is:

\[\mathbf{r} = \langle 2, -1, 2 \rangle + t \langle 3, 4, 12 \rangle\]

Then, to find the intersection with the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I can substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation, which is essentially what I did earlier.

Alternatively, I could set up the system of equations without parameters:

\[\begin{cases}

x - y + z = 5 \\

x - 2 = 3t \\

y + 1 = 4t \\

z - 2 = 12t

\end{cases}\]

Then, solve for t and the variables.

From the second equation: \(x = 3t + 2\)

From the third: \(y = 4t - 1\)

From the fourth: \(z = 12t + 2\)

Plugging these into the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Which simplifies to:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]\[11t + 5 = 5\]\[11t = 0\]\[t = 0\]

Then, x=2, y=-1, z=2, same as before.

So, regardless of the method, I arrive at the same point.

Perhaps I can also consider the direction ratios. The direction ratios of the line are 3,4,12, which can be simplified to 1,4/3,4 by dividing by 3. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the line intersects the plane, and find the foot of the perpendicular from the line to the plane, but that seems more complicated for this problem.

Given that, I think the straightforward approach of substituting the parametric equations into the plane equation and solving for t is the most efficient method.

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)}\).

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form by setting \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 11t + 5.
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0.
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

The point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).
