To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we need to list all such numbers and check their primality. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93. We will check each of these numbers to see if they are prime.

1. **3**: The number 3 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 3.
2. **13**: The number 13 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 13.
3. **23**: The number 23 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 23.
4. **33**: The number 33 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 3, 11, and 33. Specifically, \(33 = 3 \times 11\).
5. **43**: The number 43 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 43.
6. **53**: The number 53 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 53.
7. **63**: The number 63 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63. Specifically, \(63 = 3 \times 21 = 7 \times 9\).
8. **73**: The number 73 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 73.
9. **83**: The number 83 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 83.
10. **93**: The number 93 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 3, 31, and 93. Specifically, \(93 = 3 \times 31\).

From the above analysis, the prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. There are 7 such numbers.

Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{7}\).

So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Alright, let's start by understanding what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

First, I should list all the prime numbers less than 100. I know that 2 is the first prime number, and it's the only even prime number. Then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. I think that's all of them, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any.

Let me list them again:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

I'll check if there are any primes less than 100 that I might have missed. Starting from 2 up to 97, and making sure none are missing. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Yep, that seems complete.

Now, I need to identify which of these have a units digit of 3. So, looking at the list:

- 3 (units digit 3)

- 13 (units digit 3)

- 23 (units digit 3)

- 43 (units digit 3)

- 53 (units digit 3)

- 73 (units digit 3)

- 83 (units digit 3)

Let's see, are there any others? Let's check the entire list again to make sure I didn't miss any.

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

That seems to be all of them. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Wait a minute, let me confirm if 53 has a units digit of 3. Yes, it does. And 83 also ends with a 3. Okay, no issues there.

So, my final answer is 7.

## Step 4:  We know that the units digit of a number is the last digit, so we can narrow down our search to numbers ending in 3.
## Step 5:  The prime numbers less than 100 that end in 3 are 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
## Step 6:  These are the only prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.
## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3 is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$

Step 1:  To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we need to consider all the numbers less than 100 that end in 3.
Step 2:  We know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 3:  The numbers less than 100 that end in 3 are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93.
Step 4:  We need to check each of these numbers to see if they are prime.
Step 5:  Starting with 3, we know that 3 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 6:  Moving on to 13, we find that it is also a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Step 7:  Similarly, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83 are all prime numbers as they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
Step 8:  However, 33 is not a prime number as it can be divided by 3 and 11.
Step 9:  Similarly, 63 is not a prime number as it can be divided by 3 and 21.
Step 10:  Lastly, 93 is not a prime number as it can be divided by 3 and 31.
Step 11:  Therefore, the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.
Step 12:  So, the total number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is $\boxed{7}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$

 To solve this problem, we need to understand what a prime number is and how to identify one. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Now, we are looking for prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. Let's list out the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Now, let's identify which of these numbers end with the digit 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83

So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is: $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 end with the digit 3. Okay, first things first, I should list all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones have a units digit of 3.

Let me start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from the smallest:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Okay, that's all the primes less than 100. Now, I need to look at their units digits and see which ones are 3.

Looking at the list:

- 3: units digit is 3

- 13: units digit is 3

- 37: units digit is 7

- 43: units digit is 3

- 63: wait, 63 isn't in my list because it's not prime (divisible by 3).

Wait, actually, 63 is not prime; it's divisible by 3. So, skipping that.

So, from the list, the primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 43.

Is there any other prime less than 100 that ends with 3?

Let me double-check:

- 3: yes

- 13: yes

- 43: yes

- 103: but 103 is greater than 100, so not included.

So, only three primes less than 100 end with 3.

Wait a minute, is there a pattern here or something I'm missing? Let's think about this differently.

I know that for a number to be prime, it has to be greater than 1 and have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Also, if a number ends with 3, it means it can be expressed as 10k + 3 for some integer k.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this without listing all the primes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the properties of numbers ending with 3 and see if they can be prime.

For example, a number ending with 3 could be 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, etc., but we've already established that most of these aren't prime.

Wait, but in our list, only 3, 13, and 43 are primes.

Is there a mathematical reason why primes ending with 3 are rare?

Well, in general, primes can end with any digit except 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8, since those digits make the number divisible by 2 or 5.

So, primes can end with 1, 2, 3, 7, or 9.

In this case, we're interested in primes ending with 3.

Now, among these possible endings, how common are primes ending with 3?

I don't know off the top of my head, but perhaps I can think about it in terms of modular arithmetic.

A number ending with 3 would be congruent to 3 modulo 10, i.e., n ≡ 3 mod 10.

So, n = 10k + 3 for some integer k.

Now, for such a number to be prime, it must satisfy certain conditions.

First, it cannot be divisible by 2 or 5, which it isn't, since it ends with 3.

Also, it shouldn't be divisible by any prime less than its square root.

But checking each one individually seems time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for n > 3, n cannot be prime if it ends with 3, but that doesn't seem right because 3 is prime, and 13 and 43 are also prime.

Wait, but 3 is the only single-digit prime ending with 3.

Beyond that, are there any others?

Let me check:

- 13: prime

- 23: prime

- 33: not prime (divisible by 3)

- 43: prime

- 53: prime

- 63: not prime

- 73: prime

- 83: prime

- 93: not prime

- 103: prime, but greater than 100

So, from this extended list, the primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Wait, but earlier I thought only 3, 13, and 43 were less than 100.

But now, including 53, 73, and 83, which are also less than 100.

So, that makes seven primes less than 100 that end with 3.

Wait, but earlier I only had three: 3, 13, and 43.

What did I miss?

Ah, I see. In my initial list, I didn't include 53, 73, and 83 because I mistakenly thought they weren't primes.

Let me correct that.

So, the complete list of primes less than 100 is:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, looking at the units digit:

- 3: 3, 13, 43, 73

- 1: 11, 17, 19, 23, 31, 41, 61, 71, 83

- 5: 5, 25 (but 25 is not prime)

- 7: 7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97

- 9: 9, 29, 59, 79

So, primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 43, 73.

Similarly, primes ending with 1 are: 11, 17, 31, 41, 61, 71, 83.

Primes ending with 7 are: 7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97.

Primes ending with 9 are: 9, 29, 59, 79.

So, indeed, only four primes end with 3: 3, 13, 43, and 73.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were more.

Let me count them again.

From the list:

- 3: ends with 3

- 13: ends with 3

- 23: ends with 3

- 33: not prime

- 43: ends with 3

- 53: ends with 3

- 63: not prime

- 73: ends with 3

- 83: ends with 3

- 93: not prime

- 103: greater than 100

So, the primes ending with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

That's seven primes.

Wait, but earlier I thought only four ended with 3.

I must have miscounted before.

So, the correct count is seven primes less than 100 that end with 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 7.

But let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any.

Listing them again:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

Yes, that's seven primes.

So, the final answer is 7.

**Final Answer**

<<< checkpoint: Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-Llama-3.1-8B
To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 100**.
2. **Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3**.

### Step 1: Identify the prime numbers less than 100

The prime numbers less than 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

### Step 2: Filter out the prime numbers that have a units digit of 3

From the list of prime numbers, we select those that end in 3:
3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Let's verify that these are indeed prime numbers:
- 3 is a prime number.
- 13 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 13).
- 23 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 23).
- 43 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 43).
- 53 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 53).
- 73 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 73).
- 83 is a prime number (divisors are 1 and 83).

All these numbers are prime and have a units digit of 3.

### Count the prime numbers

There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
