Prime numbers ending in 3 are of the form 3, 7, or any number of the form 6n + 3 (where n is an integer). Since we're looking for primes less than 100, we can check 3, 7, and the numbers 3, 13, 19, 23, 29, 37, 43, 49, 53, 59, 63, 67, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. We can quickly eliminate 49, 63, and 81 (multiples of 3), and 49 and 97 (since they are not prime). So, there are 14 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Fine Reasoning**
First, let's understand the structure of prime numbers ending in 3. They are of the form 6n + 3, where n is an integer. To find the prime numbers less than 100, we need to find the values of n for which 6n + 3 is prime and 6n + 3 is less than 100.

We can start by checking the smallest possible value of n, which is 0 (giving us 3), and then increment n by 1 until we find a non-prime number or reach a value of n that makes 6n + 3 greater than 100.

Starting from n = 0, we have:
- 3 (prime)
- 7 (prime)
- 11 (not prime)
- 15 (not prime)
- 19 (prime)
- 23 (prime)
- 27 (not prime)
- 31 (prime)
- 35 (not prime)
- 37 (prime)
- 41 (prime)
- 45 (not prime)
- 49 (not prime)
- 53 (prime)
- 57 (not prime)
- 59 (prime)
- 61 (prime)
- 65 (not prime)
- 67 (prime)
- 71 (prime)
- 73 (prime)
- 75 (not prime)
- 77 (not prime)
- 79 (prime)
- 81 (not prime, since it's a multiple of 3)
- 83 (prime)
- 85 (not prime)
- 87 (not prime)
- 89 (prime)
- 91 (not prime)
- 93 (not prime)
- 95 (not prime)
- 97 (not prime, since it's greater than 100)

So, there are 14 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

\boxed{14} prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3.

**Coarse Reasoning**

So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Okay, first things first, I should list out all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones end with a 3.

I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from 2 upwards, let's list them out:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, I need to pick out those that end with a 3. Looking at the list:

- 3 (units digit 3)

- 13 (units digit 3)

- 23 (units digit 3)

- 43 (units digit 3)

- 53 (units digit 3)

- 73 (units digit 3)

- 83 (units digit 3)

So, it looks like there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Wait a minute, is there a smarter way to do this without listing all primes? Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me find primes ending with 3 directly.

Well, I know that primes greater than 5 must end with 1, 3, 7, or 9, because numbers ending with 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 are divisible by 2 or 5 and thus not prime (except for 2 and 5 themselves).

So, focusing on primes ending with 3, I can consider numbers like 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.

But not all of these are prime. For example, 33 is divisible by 3, and 63 is divisible by 3 and 7. So, from this list, the primes are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Again, that's 7 primes.

Is there a way to generalize this? Maybe consider numbers of the form 10k + 3, where k is a non-negative integer, and check for primality.

For k from 0 to 9 (since we're considering numbers less than 100):

- k=0: 3 (prime)

- k=1: 13 (prime)

- k=2: 23 (prime)

- k=3: 33 (not prime)

- k=4: 43 (prime)

- k=5: 53 (prime)

- k=6: 63 (not prime)

- k=7: 73 (prime)

- k=8: 83 (prime)

- k=9: 93 (not prime)

So, again, primes are for k=0,1,2,4,5,7,8, which is 7 primes.

I think that's pretty much it. Unless there's some advanced number theory that can help simplify this further, but for the purpose of this problem, listing them out seems straightforward enough.

Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.  We need to check numbers ending in 3 less than 100 and see if they fit this rule.  There aren't many to check, so this should be doable.

**Fine Reasoning**

Here are the numbers less than 100 that end in 3:

3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93

Let's check each for primality:

* 3 is prime
* 13 is prime
* 23 is prime
* 33 is divisible by 3, so not prime
* 43 is prime
* 53 is prime
* 63 is divisible by 3, so not prime
* 73 is prime
* 83 is prime
* 93 is divisible by 3, so not prime

To find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can list the prime numbers less than 100 and count those that end in 3. The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Among these, the prime numbers with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. Thus, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Fine Reasoning:**
To solve this problem, we need to identify prime numbers less than 100 and then filter those that have a units digit of 3. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can use a simple algorithm to generate prime numbers and check their units digit.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, 2.
2. Check if the number ends in 3. If it does, add it to the list of prime numbers with a units digit of 3.
3. Continue this process for all prime numbers less than 100.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python to find the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# List to store prime numbers with units digit of 3
prime_numbers_with_3 = []

# Check prime numbers less than 100
for i in range(2, 100):
    if is_prime(i) and i % 10 == 3:
        prime_numbers_with_3.append(i)

# Print the result
print(len(prime_numbers_with_3))
```

**Final Answer:** The number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{7}\).

To solve this problem, we need to identify prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Coarse Reasoning:**
- Prime numbers less than 100 ending in 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. These are the only numbers less than 100 that end in 3 and are prime.

**Fine Reasoning:**
- We can systematically check each number less than 100 that ends in 3 to see if it is prime. A prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
- Starting from 3 and moving up, we check each number:
 - 3 is prime.
 - 13 is prime.
 - 23 is prime.
 - 33 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 11).
 - 43 is prime.
 - 53 is prime.
 - 63 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 21).
 - 73 is prime.
 - 83 is prime.
 - 93 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 31).

To determine how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3, we need to identify the prime numbers in this range and then check their units digit.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

Let's verify these numbers to ensure they are prime:

- 3 is prime.
- 13 is prime.
- 23 is prime.
- 43 is prime.
- 53 is prime.
- 73 is prime.
- 83 is prime.

All of these numbers are prime, and they all have a units digit of 3. Therefore, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

The final answer is \(\boxed{7}\).

 To solve this problem, we need to understand what a prime number is and how to identify one. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

We are asked to find the number of prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. 

Let's start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3:

3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83, 93

We can see that there are 8 prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3.

So, the answer is $\boxed{8}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. So, there are 7 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3. The answer is: $\boxed{7}$.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: PowerInfer/SmallThinker-3B-Preview
So I need to find out how many prime numbers less than 100 end with the digit 3. Okay, let's start by listing all the prime numbers less than 100 and then see which ones have a units digit of 3.

First, I'll list all the prime numbers less than 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, from this list, I need to identify those that have a units digit of 3. Looking at the list:

- 3 is prime and ends with 3.

- 13 is prime and ends with 3.

- 23 is prime and ends with 3.

- 43 is prime and ends with 3.

- 53 is prime and ends with 3.

- 73 is prime and ends with 3.

- 83 is prime and ends with 3.

So, these are the primes less than 100 that end with 3: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.

Let me count them: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83. That's seven numbers.

Wait a minute, is there any other prime number less than 100 that ends with 3 that I might have missed? Let's double-check the list.

Starting from the smallest:

- 3

- 13

- 23

- 43

- 53

- 73

- 83

Yes, those are all the primes less than 100 that end with 3. So, there are seven such primes.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any two-digit primes ending with 3 beyond 83 that are less than 100. Let's think about it.

The next multiple of 10 is 90, so the next possible number would be 93, but 93 is not prime because it's divisible by 3 (9+3=12, which is divisible by 3). Similarly, 83 is the highest single-digit unit followed by 3 in the tens place below 100.

Therefore, the only primes less than 100 that end with 3 are indeed 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

So, the answer should be 7.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{7} \]

### Planning Phase

**Key Steps:**
1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: Generate a list of prime numbers less than 100.
2. **Filter by Units Digit**: Filter the list to include only those prime numbers whose units digit is 3.
3. **Count the Filtered List**: Count the number of prime numbers in the filtered list.

**Important Considerations:**
- **Prime Number Generation**: Use an efficient method to generate prime numbers, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- **Units Digit Check**: Ensure the units digit check is correctly implemented.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as the smallest prime number (2) and the largest prime number less than 100 (97).

### Code Solution

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    """Generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes."""
    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)
    p = 2
    while (p * p <= limit):
        if (is_prime[p] == True):
            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    prime_numbers = [p for p in range(2, limit) if is_prime[p]]
    return prime_numbers

def count_primes_with_units_digit_3(limit, units_digit):
    """Count prime numbers less than the given limit that have a specific units digit."""
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
    filtered_primes = [p for p in primes if p % 10 == units_digit]
    return len(filtered_primes)

# Define the limit and the units digit
limit = 100
units_digit = 3

# Get the count of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3
result = count_primes_with_units_digit_3(limit, units_digit)
print(result)
```

### Solution Explanation

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - The `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function generates all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
   - It initializes a boolean list `is_prime` where each index represents whether the number is prime.
   - It iterates through the list, marking multiples of each prime number starting from 2 as non-prime.
   - Finally, it collects all indices marked as `True` (prime) into a list of prime numbers.

2. **Filtering by Units Digit**:
   - The `count_primes_with_units_digit_3` function takes the list of prime numbers and filters them based on the units digit.
   - It uses a list comprehension to create a new list `filtered_primes` containing only those primes whose units digit matches the specified `units_digit`.

3. **Counting the Filtered List**:
   - The length of the `filtered_primes` list is calculated, which gives the count of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Clarity and Breakdown**:
- **Prime Generation**: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for generating prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.
- **Units Digit Check**: The units digit of a number can be obtained using the modulus operator `%`. For example, `p % 10` gives the units digit of `p`.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases by ensuring that the list of primes is correctly generated and filtered. The smallest prime number (2) and the largest prime number less than 100 (97) are included in the list.

**Final Answer**:
The number of prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 is \(\boxed{5}\). The prime numbers are 3, 13, 23, 43, and 73.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: 01-ai/Yi-1.5-34B-Chat-16K
**Coarse Reasoning**
To find prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can simply list the numbers ending in 3 and check which ones are prime. The numbers are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83. Checking these, we find they are all prime except for 13 and 53. Therefore, there are 5 such prime numbers.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}

**Fine Reasoning**
To determine the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we first identify all the numbers that end in 3 within this range. These numbers are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93. However, since we're looking for primes, we can eliminate multiples of 3 (33, 63, 93) and even numbers greater than 2 (since all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime), which leaves us with 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.

Next, we check each of these numbers for primality. A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can quickly eliminate 13 and 53 because they are prime but do not end in 3 (as per our initial criteria). This leaves us with 3, 23, 43, 73, and 83.

- 3 is prime.
- 23 is prime.
- 43 is prime.
- 73 is prime.
- 83 is prime.

Therefore, there are 5 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}

The detailed analysis and refined answer confirm that there are indeed 5 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.

**Coarse Reasoning**
To find prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we only need to consider the numbers that end with 3, as primes greater than 3 are either 1 or 3 modulo 6. Since the only prime numbers less than 100 that end with 3 are 3 itself and 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93, we can quickly see that only 13 and 23 are prime.

**Fine Reasoning**
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. To find prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we can list all the numbers that end with 3 and check if they are prime.

Numbers less than 100 that end with 3 are: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93.

Checking each of these numbers:
- 3 is a prime number.
- 13 is a prime number.
- 23 is a prime number.
- 33 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 11).

**Coarse Reasoning**

We need to find prime numbers less than 100 that end with the digit 3. The only possible unit's digits for prime numbers (other than 2 and 5, which do not end with 3) are 1, 3, 7, and 9. Since we are only interested in numbers ending with 3, we can quickly eliminate any number divisible by 3 from being prime, as per the divisibility rule of 3. This leaves us with numbers like 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, which are candidates for our prime numbers ending with 3.

**Fine Reasoning**

To confirm if these numbers are indeed prime, we can check for divisibility by prime numbers less than their square root. The square root of the largest number in our list, 83, is approximately 9.1, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 9.

- 13 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.
- 23 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.
- 43 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.
- 53 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.
- 73 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.
- 83 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so it is prime.

All six numbers are prime, and they all end with the digit 3.

**Final Answer**

There are 6 prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be used to describe machines that actually do think like humans. AI is a field that has been around for decades, but it has seen a significant resurgence in interest and development in recent years, largely due to advances in computing power, the availability of large datasets, and new algorithms.

AI systems can be broadly categorized into three types:

1. **Narrow AI** or **Weak AI**: This is the type of AI we see in most of today's technology. It is designed to perform specific tasks and is usually built into applications and devices such as personal assistants (like Siri or Alexa), spam filters, and recommendation systems. Narrow AI is effective within its specific domain but lacks general intelligence.

2. **General AI** or **Strong AI**: This would be AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge in any situation like a human being. It would require the development of a truly general-purpose intelligence, capable of learning and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks. General AI is still largely a topic of speculation and science fiction, as it remains beyond current technological capabilities.

3. **Superintelligent AI**: This is a hypothetical next step beyond general AI, where machines would surpass human intelligence in virtually all domains. The implications of creating a superintelligent AI are profound and uncertain, raising ethical, philosophical, and safety concerns.

AI technologies are based on various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
