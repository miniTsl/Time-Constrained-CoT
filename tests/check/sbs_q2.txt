To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations simultaneously. We have three equations:

1. Equation of the line in three variables:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

2. The additional equation given:
   \[x - y + z = 5\]

Let's first solve the line equation for two variables, say x and y. We can rewrite the line equation as:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t
\end{cases}\]

Now substitute these expressions for x and y into the third equation:

\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + z = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3t + z = 6\]

Now we have two equations for z:

1. From the line equation:
   \[z = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2\]

2. From the simplified third equation:
   \[z = 6 - 3t\]

Equate the two expressions for z:

\[12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = 6 - 3t\]

Solve for t:

\[t = \frac{x - 2}{3} - \frac{1}{4}\]

Now substitute this expression for t back into the equation for z:

\[z = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = 6 - 3\left(\frac{x - 2}{3} - \frac{1}{4}\right)\]

Simplify the equation:

\[z = \frac{3x - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\]

Now we have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of x:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3t \\
y = -1 + 4t \\
z = \frac{3x - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}\]

Substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the equation for z:

\[z = \frac{3(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\]

Now substitute the expression for z back into the third equation:

\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + \frac{3(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[6t + \frac{6(2 + 3t) - 10}{3} = 5\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[18t + 6(2 + 3t) - 10 = 15\]

Expand and simplify:

\[18t + 12 + 18t - 10 = 15\]

Combine like terms:

\[36t = 5\]

Divide both sides by 36:

\[t = \frac{1}{7}\]

Now substitute t back into the expressions for x, y, and z:

\[\begin{cases}
x = 2 + 3\left(\frac{1}{7}\right) = \boxed{\frac{11}{7}} \\
y = -1 + 4\left(\frac{1}{7}\right) = \boxed{\frac{3}{7}} \\
z = \frac{3\left(\frac{11}{7}\right) - 10}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{7} - \frac{34}{21} + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{10}{21}}
\end{cases}\]

So the point of intersection is \boxed{\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{10}{21}\right)}.

**Final Answer:** \boxed{\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{10}{21}\right)}

\]
\[
5 + 11t = 5,

 First, let's denote the common ratio as $k$. So we have:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = k\]

From this, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $k$:

\[x = 3k + 2\]
\[y = 4k - 1\]
\[z = 12k + 2\]

Now, substitute these expressions into the equation $x - y + z = 5$:

\[(3k + 2) - (4k - 1) + (12k + 2) = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3k + 2 - 4k + 1 + 12k + 2 = 5\]
\[11k + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11k = 0\]

Divide both sides by 11:

\[k = 0\]

Now, substitute $k = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]

So I have this problem here. I need to find the point where a given line intersects with a plane. The line is given in a parametric form, and the plane is given by an equation. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, the line is given by:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

And the plane is:

\[x - y + z = 5\]

I need to find the point where these two intersect.

Okay, so the line is in parametric form, but it's not given in the standard parametric equations. It's given in symmetric form. I know that in symmetric form, the equations represent the direction ratios of the line.

So, I can denote the symmetric form as:

\[\frac{x - x_1}{a} = \frac{y - y_1}{b} = \frac{z - z_1}{c}\]

Where \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) is a point on the line, and \(a, b, c\) are the direction ratios.

Comparing this with the given line equation:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

I can see that the point \((2, -1, 2)\) lies on the line, and the direction ratios are \(3, 4, 12\).

Now, to find the intersection with the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I need to find a point that lies on both the line and the plane.

One way to do this is to express the coordinates \(x, y, z\) in terms of a parameter, say \(t\), using the direction ratios, and then substitute these into the plane equation to solve for \(t\).

So, let's parameterize the line.

Let:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]

Then, I can express \(x, y, z\) in terms of \(t\):

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

Now, since this point \((x, y, z)\) lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I can substitute these expressions into the plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me simplify this:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combining like terms:

\[(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5\]\[(11t) + 5 = 5\]

So:

\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]

Therefore:

\[t = 0\]

Now that I have \(t = 0\), I can plug this back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

So:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Wait a minute, but let me verify if this point actually lies on the plane.

Substitute \(x = 2\), \(y = -1\), \(z = 2\) into the plane equation:

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\]

Yes, it satisfies the plane equation. So, the point is correct.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

\[11t + 5 = 5,\]so $t = 0$.
Substituting $t = 0$ back into the equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we find that the point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$.

To find the point of intersection of the line given by the symmetric equations

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}
\]

and the plane given by the equation

\[
x - y + z = 5,
\]

we start by parameterizing the line. Let

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.
\]

From this, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of the parameter \(t\):

\[
x - 2 = 3t \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3t + 2,
\]

\[
y + 1 = 4t \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 4t - 1,
\]

\[
z - 2 = 12t \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 12t + 2.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation:

\[
x - y + z = 5.
\]

Substituting, we have:

\[
(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5.
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,
\]

\[
11t + 5 = 5.
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0.
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = 0.
\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parameterized equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,
\]

\[
y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,
\]

\[
z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equation of the line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and the equation of the plane as $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing the equation of the line in parametric form to make it easier to work with.
Let's express $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t.$ From the equation of the line, we have $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t.$

## Step 3: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection.
Substituting $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5,$ we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$

## Step 4: Solve for $t$ in the resulting equation from step 3.
Simplifying the equation $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5,$ we get $5 + 11t = 5.$ Solving for $t,$ we find $t = 0.$

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $t$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into the parametric equations $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t,$ we get $x = 2,$ $y = -1,$ and $z = 2.$

## Step 6: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equations $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing each equation in terms of a single variable, say $x$, to simplify the system.
From the first equation, we can express $y$ and $z$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = \frac{12}{3}(x - 2) = 4(x - 2)$.

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $y$ and $z$ into the second equation to get an equation in terms of $x$ only.
Substituting $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ and $z = 4(x - 2)$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get $x - \frac{4}{3}(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = 5$.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation to solve for $x$.
Expanding the equation gives $x - \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{8}{3} + 4x - 8 = 5$. Combining like terms yields $\frac{5}{3}x - 8 = 5$. Adding 8 to both sides gives $\frac{5}{3}x = 13$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{5}$ gives $x = 39/5$.

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $x$ back into the expressions for $y$ and $z$ to find their values.
Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$ gives $y = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{15}$. Substituting $x = 39/5$ into $z = 4(x - 2)$ gives $z = 4(\frac{39}{5} - 2) = 4(\frac{39 - 10}{5}) = 4(\frac{29}{5}) = \frac{116}{5}$.

## Step 6: The point of intersection is given by the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ found in the previous steps.
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

## Step 7: We can simplify the point of intersection by finding a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator for the fractions is 15. So, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{3}, \frac{116}{15} \cdot \frac{1}{1}, \frac{116}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{117}{15}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{348}{15}\right)$.

The point of intersection is $\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{116}{15}, \frac{348}{15}\right) = \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{29}{5}, \frac{116}{5}\right)$.

Step 1:  To find the point of intersection between the given line and the plane, we first need to express the line in a more convenient form. The line is given in the symmetric form as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.$ This means that the line passes through the point $(2,-1,2)$ and has direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}.$
Step 2:  We can parameterize the line using the point and the direction vector. Let $t$ be a parameter, then the line can be expressed as $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\ -1 + 4t \\ 2 + 12t \end{pmatrix}.$
Step 3:  Now, we need to find the point of intersection of this line with the plane $x - y + z = 5.$ To do this, we substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane.
Step 4:  Substituting $x = 2 + 3t,$ $y = -1 + 4t,$ and $z = 2 + 12t$ into the equation of the plane, we get $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$
Step 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $5 + 11t = 5.$ Solving for $t$, we find that $t = 0.$
Step 6:  Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line, we get the point of intersection as $(2, -1, 2).$
Step 7:  Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the plane is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}.$

The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}$

To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we start by expressing the line in parametric form. The line is given by:

\[
\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t
\]

From this, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):

\[
x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the plane equation \(x - y + z = 5\):

\[
(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5 + 11t = 5
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
11t = 0
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = 0
\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\[
x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 + 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2
\]

Thus, the point of intersection is:

\[
\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}
\]

To find the point of intersection between the line and the plane, we first need to express the line in parametric form. The given line is:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2\]

where \(t\) is a parameter.

Next, we substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation \(x - y + z = 5\):

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Simplify the equation:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[11t + 5 = 5\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0\]

Divide by 11:

\[t = 0\]

Now, substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the point of intersection:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\]
\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\]
\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\]

Thus, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

\[\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\]

 First, we can rewrite the parametric equations of the line as $x = 3t + 2$, $y = 4t - 1$, and $z = 12t + 2$.
Substituting these into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives $19t + 3 = 5$, so $19t = 2$ and $t = \frac{2}{19}$.
Substituting this value of $t$ back into the parametric equations, we find the point of intersection:
\[x = 3\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) + 2 = \frac{6}{19} + 2 = \frac{6 + 38}{19} = \frac{44}{19},\]
\[y = 4\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{8}{19} - 1 = \frac{8 - 19}{19} = -\frac{11}{19},\]
and $z = 12\left(\frac{2}{19}\right) + 2 = \frac{24}{19} + 2 = \frac{24 + 38}{19} = \frac{62}{19}$.
Therefore, the point of intersection is $\left(\frac{44}{19}, -\frac{11}{19}, \frac{62}{19}\right)$. The answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{44}{19}, -\frac{11}{19}, \frac{62}{19}\right)}$

To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute this into the equation of the plane to solve for the parameter.

The given line is in the form:
$$\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$$

This can be rewritten in parametric form as:
$$x = 3t + 2$$
$$y = 4t - 1$$
$$z = 12t + 2$$

where $t$ is a parameter.

The equation of the plane is given by:
$$x - y + z = 5$$

Substituting the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane, we get:
$$3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5$$
$$11t + 5 = 5$$
$$11t = 0$$
$$t = 0$$

Now, we substitute $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the point of intersection:
$$x = 3(0) + 2 = 2$$
$$y = 4(0) - 1 = -1$$
$$z = 12(0) + 2 = 2$$

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$.
The final answer is \boxed{(2,-1,2)}

To find the point of intersection of the given line and plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane. The line is given by:
$$\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.$$
Let's denote the common parameter by $t$. Thus, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ as follows:
$$x = 3t + 2,$$
$$y = 4t - 1,$$
$$z = 12t + 2.$$

The equation of the plane is given by:
$$x - y + z = 5.$$

Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ into the equation of the plane, we get:
$$(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,$$
$$11t + 5 = 5.$$

Solving for $t$:
$$11t = 0,$$
$$t = 0.$$

Substituting $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
$$x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,$$
$$y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,$$
$$z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.$$

Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$.

 From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4},$ $4x - 8 = 3y + 3,$ so $4x - 3y = 11.$

From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{z - 2}{12},$ $12x - 24 = 3z - 6,$ so $4x - z = 18.$

Thus, the line is parameterized by
\begin{align*}
x &= t + 2, \\
y &= 4t - 3, \\
z &= 4t - 18.
\end{align*}Setting $x = y + z + 5,$ we get $t + 2 = (4t - 3) + (4t - 18) + 5.$  Solving, we find $t = -2.$  Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(0, -11, -22)}.$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 The given line can be rewritten as a system of equations:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = t, \quad \frac{y + 1}{4} = t, \quad \frac{z - 2}{12} = t.\]
Solving each equation for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 - 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]
We substitute these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 - 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[2 + 3t + 1 + 4t + 2 + 12t = 5.\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[19t + 5 = 5.\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[19t = 0.\]
Dividing both sides by 19 gives:
\[t = 0.\]
Substituting $t = 0$ back into the equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives:
\[x = 2 + 3(0) = 2, \quad y = -1 - 4(0) = -1, \quad z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]
So the point of intersection is $(2, -1, 2)$. The answer is: $\boxed{(2,-1,2)}$

So I have this problem here: find the point of intersection of the line given by

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\]

and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The first equation is that of a line in space, parameterized by x, y, and z with some ratios. The second is a plane defined by an equation involving x, y, and z.

I recall that to find the intersection between a line and a plane, I need to find a point that lies on both the line and the plane. So, if I can express the coordinates (x, y, z) in terms of a single variable for the line, and then plug those into the plane's equation, I should be able to solve for that variable and find the specific point.

Let me start by expressing the parametric equations of the line from the given symmetric equations. The symmetric equations are:

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t \quad \text{(let's call this parameter } t)\]

So, I can write:

\[x = 3t + 2\]\[y = 4t - 1\]\[z = 12t + 2\]

Now, since this line lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), plugging these expressions into the plane's equation should give me an equation in terms of t that I can solve.

Substituting:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Let me compute that:

\(3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\)

Combining like terms:

(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5

That simplifies to:

11t + 5 = 5

Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the substitution:

\(x = 3t + 2\)

\(y = 4t - 1\)

\(z = 12t + 2\)

Plugging into \(x - y + z = 5\):

\((3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\)

Yes, that's correct. Now, distributing the negative sign:

\(3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\)

Now, combining like terms:

For t terms: 3t - 4t + 12t = (3 - 4 + 12)t = 11t

For constant terms: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

So, indeed, 11t + 5 = 5

Now, solving for t:

11t + 5 = 5

Subtract 5 from both sides:

11t = 0

Therefore, t = 0

Now that I have t = 0, I can plug this back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

From earlier:

\(x = 3t + 2 = 3(0) + 2 = 2\)

\(y = 4t - 1 = 4(0) - 1 = -1\)

\(z = 12t + 2 = 12(0) + 2 = 2\)

So, the point should be (2, -1, 2)

But wait, let me verify this by plugging these values back into the plane's equation to ensure they satisfy it.

Plane equation: \(x - y + z = 5\)

Plugging in x=2, y=-1, z=2:

\(2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\)

Yes, it checks out.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.

Another method could be to use vectors. The direction vector of the line is <3, 4, 12>, and the normal vector of the plane is <1, -1, 1>.

The general formula for the intersection of a line and a plane is to set up the system where the line's parametric equations satisfy the plane's equation.

Which is essentially what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the line intersects the plane, so their parametric representations must coincide at some point.

But I think my initial approach is solid.

Just to be thorough, maybe I can consider eliminating parameters differently.

Suppose I solve one of the parametric equations for t and substitute into the others.

From the line's parametric equations:

\(x = 3t + 2\) → \(t = \frac{x - 2}{3}\)

\(y = 4t - 1\) → \(t = \frac{y + 1}{4}\)

\(z = 12t + 2\) → \(t = \frac{z - 2}{12}\)

Setting them equal:

\(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\)

This brings me back to the original symmetric equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third using the line's parametric equations and then plug into the plane's equation.

For example, express y and z in terms of x.

From \(x = 3t + 2\), we get \(t = \frac{x - 2}{3}\)

Then, \(y = 4t - 1 = 4\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) - 1 = \frac{4(x - 2)}{3} - 1\)

Similarly, \(z = 12t + 2 = 12\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = 4(x - 2) + 2 = 4x - 8 + 2 = 4x - 6\)

Now, plug these into the plane's equation:

\(x - y + z = 5\)

Substitute y and z:

\(x - \left(\frac{4(x - 2)}{3} - 1\right) + (4x - 6) = 5\)

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\(x - \left(\frac{4x - 8}{3} - 1\right) + 4x - 6 = 5\)

Distribute the negative sign:

\(x - \frac{4x - 8}{3} + 1 + 4x - 6 = 5\)

Combine like terms:

\(x + 4x - \frac{4x - 8}{3} + 1 - 6 = 5\)

Simplify further:

\(5x - \frac{4x - 8}{3} - 5 = 5\)

Add 5 to both sides:

\(5x - \frac{4x - 8}{3} = 10\)

To eliminate the denominator, multiply every term by 3:

\(15x - (4x - 8) = 30\)

Simplify:

\(15x - 4x + 8 = 30\)

\(11x + 8 = 30\)

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\(11x = 22\)

Divide by 11:

\(x = 2\)

Now, plug x = 2 back into the expressions for y and z:

\(y = \frac{4(2) - 8}{3} - 1 = \frac{8 - 8}{3} - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1\)

\(z = 4(2) - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2\)

Again, I get the point (2, -1, 2), which matches my previous result.

Perhaps I can also check if this point satisfies the original line's parametric equations.

From the parametric equations:

\(x = 3t + 2\)

Set x = 2:

\(2 = 3t + 2\) → \(3t = 0\) → \(t = 0\)

Then, \(y = 4t - 1 = -1\)

And \(z = 12t + 2 = 2\)

Same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can use matrices or something else, but I think this is sufficient.

I feel confident that the point of intersection is (2, -1, 2).

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,\ -1,\ 2)} \]

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form by letting \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 11t + 5.
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0.
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

The point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).
