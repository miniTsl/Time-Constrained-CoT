**Coarse Reasoning**
We have a system of three linear equations in three variables: x, y, and z. To find the point of intersection, we need to solve this system simultaneously. First, we can rearrange the given equation to form three equations in standard form (Ax + By + Cz = D). Then, we can use methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix algebra to solve for the variables. The point of intersection will be the solution to this system.

**Fine Reasoning**
1. Rearranging the given equation:
   a) x - 2 = 3y/4
   b) y + 1 = 4z/12 - 4/3
   c) x - y + z = 5

2. Simplifying the second equation:
   y = (12/4)z/12 - 4/3
   y = 3z/12 - 4/3

3. Substituting y from the second equation into the first equation:
   x - 2 = (3/4)(3z/12 - 4/3)
   x - 2 = (9/12)z - (12/12)
   x - 2 = (9/12)z - 1

4. Simplifying the third equation:
   x - y + z = 5
   x - (3z/12 - 4/3) + z = 5

5. Substituting y from the second equation into the third equation:
   x - (3/12)(12z - 36) + z = 5
   x - (9/12)z + (36/12) + z = 5

6. Combining like terms:
   x + (11/12)z = 21/12

7. Multiplying both sides by 12 to eliminate the fraction:
   12x + (11z) = 21

8. Rearranging the equation:
   12x + 11z - 21 = 0

9. We now have a linear equation in two variables, which can be solved using methods like the substitution or elimination method or matrix algebra. However, since the given system already has three equations, we can use the third equation to eliminate z from the new equation.

10. Substituting z from the first equation into the new equation:
    12(x - 2) + 11((3/4)(3z/12 - 4/3)) - 21 = 0

11. Simplifying and rearranging:
    12x - 24 + (9/4)z - (33/4) - 21 = 0
    12x - (33/4) - (15/4)z = 24

12. Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
    48x - (33) - 15z = 96

13. Rearranging the equation:
    48x + 15z - 33 = 96

14. Now we have a linear equation in two variables, x and z. We can solve this equation using the substitution or elimination method or matrix algebra. However, since we have only two variables, we can solve this equation directly for one variable, say z.

15. Solving for z:
    z = (96 - 48x + 33)/15

16. Substituting z back into the first equation:
    x - 2 = (3/4)((96 - 48x + 33)/15 - 4/3)

17. Solving for x:
    x - 2 = (288 - 192x + 132)/60
    x - 2 = (132 - 192x)/60
    x - 2 = (-140 + 192x)/60
    x = (140 - 192x)/60 + 2
    x(192) + 140(60) = 192x + 8400 = 140y + 12000
    x(192) - 140y = 3600
    x = (3600 + 140y)/192

18. Substituting z back into the third equation:
    x - y + z = 5
    x - y + ((96 - 48x + 33)/15) = 5

19. Solving for y:
    y = (5 - x + 48x - 33)/15
    y = (43 - 47x)/15

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection of the given line and the plane is \boxed{\left(\frac{3600 + 140y}{192}, y, \frac{96 - 48x + 33}{15}\right)}. To find specific values for x, y, and z, we can choose a specific value for y and solve for x and z using the equations derived above.

**Fine Reasoning**
1. From the line equation, we have:
   \[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\]
   This implies:
   \[x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2\]

2. Substitute these into the plane equation:

   Simplify and solve for $t$:
   \[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
   \[11t + 5 = 5\]
   \[11t = 0\]
   \[t = 0\]

3. Substitute $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:

The given equations represent a line in three-dimensional space. The first equation can be rewritten as $4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) = z - 2$. This implies that $x - 2$, $y + 1$, and $z - 2$ are all multiples of 3. The second equation, $x - y + z = 5$, can be used to find the specific values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy both equations. Since $x - 2$ is a multiple of 3, let's assume $x - 2 = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Then, $x = 3k + 2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $3k + 2 - y + z = 5$. Since $z - 2$ is also a multiple of 3, let's assume $z - 2 = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then, $z = 3m + 2$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $3k + 2 - y + 3m + 2 = 5$. Simplifying, we get $3k + 3m - y = 1$. Since $y + 1$ is a multiple of 3, let's assume $y + 1 = 3n$ for some integer $n$. Then, $y = 3n - 1$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $3k + 3m - (3n - 1) = 1$. Simplifying, we get $3k + 3m - 3n = 2$. This equation has infinitely many solutions, but we can find one specific solution by choosing values for $k$, $m$, and $n$ that satisfy the equation. For example, if we choose $k = 1$, $m = 0$, and $n = 1$, we get $x = 5$, $y = 2$, and $z = 2$. Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(5, 2, 2)}$.

**Fine Reasoning**
The given equations represent a line in three-dimensional space. The first equation can be rewritten as $4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) = z - 2$. This implies that $x - 2$, $y + 1$, and $z - 2$ are all multiples of 3. The second equation, $x - y + z = 5$, can be used to find the specific values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy both equations.

Let's start by finding the general form of the line. From the first equation, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of a parameter $t$ as follows:
\[x = 2 + 3t,\]
\[y = -1 + 4t,\]
\[z = 2 + 12t.\]

Substituting these expressions into the second equation, we get:
\[(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[3t + 4t + 12t = 5 - 2 - 1,\]
\[19t = 2.\]

Solving for $t$, we get:
\[t = \frac{2}{19}.\]

Substituting this value of $t$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = 2 + 3 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{44}{19},\]
\[y = -1 + 4 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{6}{19},\]
\[z = 2 + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{19} = \frac{46}{19}.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is $\boxed{\left(\frac{44}{19}, \frac{6}{19}, \frac{46}{19}\right)}$.

Solving for $t$ gives $t = 0$. Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parameterized equations gives the intersection point $(2, -1, 2)$.

To find the intersection, let's set up our system of equations:

1. From the line equation: $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t$
   This gives us three expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:

So I have this problem here: find the point where the line given by \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) intersects the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, first things first, I need to understand what this line represents. It looks like it's in parametric form, where the ratios are equal. Maybe I can set a parameter to represent these ratios.

Let me set \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\), where \(t\) is a parameter. That means I can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(t\):

\(x = 3t + 2\),

\(y = 4t - 1\),

\(z = 12t + 2\).

Now, I have parametric equations for the line. Next, I need to find where this line intersects the plane given by \(x - y + z = 5\). So, I can substitute these expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the plane equation.

Substituting:

\((3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\).

Let me simplify that:

\(3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\),

Combining like terms:

\( (3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5\),

That's:

\(11t + 5 = 5\),

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\(11t = 0\),

So, \(t = 0\).

Now, plug \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\(x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\),

\(y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\),

\(z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\).

Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

Wait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check by plugging these values back into the plane equation:

\(2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\), which matches the plane equation. So, it seems right.

But just to be thorough, let's make sure that these values also satisfy the line equation. If \(t = 0\), then \(x = 2\), \(y = -1\), \(z = 2\), which matches the calculations.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

## Step 1: To find the point of intersection, we first need to express the given line in a more manageable form.
We can rewrite the given line as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t,$ where $t$ is a parameter.

## Step 2: Express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$.
From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = t,$ we get $x = 3t + 2.$ From $\frac{y + 1}{4} = t,$ we get $y = 4t - 1.$ From $\frac{z - 2}{12} = t,$ we get $z = 12t + 2.$

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$ to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection.
Substituting $x = 3t + 2,$ $y = 4t - 1,$ and $z = 12t + 2$ into the equation of the plane, we get $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.$

## Step 4: Solve for $t$.
Simplifying the equation $(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5,$ we get $11t + 5 = 5.$ Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get $11t = 0.$ Dividing both sides by 11, we get $t = 0.$

## Step 5: Substitute the value of $t$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.
Substituting $t = 0$ into $x = 3t + 2,$ we get $x = 3(0) + 2 = 2.$ Substituting $t = 0$ into $y = 4t - 1,$ we get $y = 4(0) - 1 = -1.$ Substituting $t = 0$ into $z = 12t + 2,$ we get $z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.$

## Step 6: Write the final answer in the required format.
The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  -1, \  2\right)}$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<< checkpoint: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
## Step 1: To find the point of intersection of the line, we need to solve the system of equations given by the line and the plane.
We have the equations $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$ and $x - y + z = 5.$

## Step 2: We can start by expressing each equation in terms of a single variable to simplify the system.
From the first equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$ as $x = 3y + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 3: Substitute the expression for $x$ into the second equation to eliminate $x$.
Substituting $x = 3y + 2 + 12z$ into $x - y + z = 5$ gives $3y + 2 + 12z - y + z = 5.$

## Step 4: Simplify the resulting equation to solve for $y$ in terms of $z$.
Simplifying the equation gives $2y + 13z = 3.$

## Step 5: Express $y$ in terms of $z$.
$y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}.$

## Step 6: Substitute the expression for $y$ into the expression for $x$ to find $x$ in terms of $z$.
Substituting $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ into $x = 3y + 2 + 12z$ gives $x = 3\left(\frac{3 - 13z}{2}\right) + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 7: Simplify the expression for $x$.
Simplifying the expression gives $x = \frac{9 - 39z}{2} + 2 + 12z.$

## Step 8: Further simplify the expression for $x$.
$x = \frac{9 - 39z + 4 + 24z}{2}.$

## Step 9: Combine like terms in the numerator.
$x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}.$

## Step 10: Now we have the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$.
We have $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ and $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}.$

## Step 11: Substitute the expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$ to solve for $z$.
Substituting $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ and $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ into $x - y + z = 5$ gives $\frac{13 - 15z}{2} - \frac{3 - 13z}{2} + z = 5.$

## Step 12: Simplify the equation to solve for $z$.
Simplifying the equation gives $\frac{10 - 28z}{2} + z = 5.$

## Step 13: Combine like terms and solve for $z$.
$10 - 28z + 2z = 10.$

## Step 14: Combine like terms and solve for $z$.
$-26z = 0.$

## Step 15: Solve for $z$.
$z = 0.$

## Step 16: Substitute the value of $z$ back into the expression for $x$ to find the value of $x$.
Substituting $z = 0$ into $x = \frac{13 - 15z}{2}$ gives $x = \frac{13 - 15(0)}{2}.$

## Step 17: Simplify the expression for $x$.
$x = \frac{13}{2}.$

## Step 18: Substitute the value of $z$ back into the expression for $y$ to find the value of $y$.
Substituting $z = 0$ into $y = \frac{3 - 13z}{2}$ gives $y = \frac{3 - 13(0)}{2}.$

## Step 19: Simplify the expression for $y$.
$y = \frac{3}{2}.$

## Step 20: The point of intersection is $\left(\frac{13}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 0\right).$

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{13}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 0\right)}$

Step 3: We can substitute these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$ to solve for $\lambda$.

Step 4: Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the equation $x - y + z = 5$, we get $(3\lambda + 2) - (4\lambda - 1) + (12\lambda + 2) = 5$.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get $11\lambda + 5 = 5$.

Step 6: Solving for $\lambda$, we get $\lambda = 0$.

Step 7: Now that we have the value of $\lambda$, we can substitute it back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to find the point of intersection.

Step 8: Substituting $\lambda = 0$ into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get $x = 3(0) + 2 = 2$, $y = 4(0) - 1 = -1$, and $z = 12(0) + 2 = 2$.

To find the point of intersection of the given equations, we start by analyzing the equations. The first equation is a system of three linear equations in three variables, and the second equation is a plane equation. The goal is to find a point that satisfies both equations simultaneously.

**Fine Reasoning**
To solve this, we can use the method of elimination. First, we can eliminate one of the variables by multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, which gives us:
\[4(x - 2) = 3(y + 1) = 12(z - 2)\]
This simplifies to:
\[4x - 8 = 3y + 3 = 12z - 24\]
From this, we can express each variable in terms of the other two:
\[4x - 3y = 11\]
\[3y + 12z = 27\]

Next, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. We can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 to align the coefficients of $y$:
\[12x - 9y = 33\]
\[12y + 48z = 108\]

Adding these two equations eliminates $y$:
\[12x - 9y + 12y + 48z = 33 + 108\]
\[12x + 3z = 141\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3:
\[4x + z = 47\]

Now, we can substitute $z = 47 - 4x$ into the second original equation $x - y + z = 5$:
\[x - y + (47 - 4x) = 5\]
\[x - y - 4x + 47 = 5\]
\[-3x - y + 47 = 5\]
\[-3x - y = -42\]
\[x + y = 14\]

Finally, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:
\[x = 14 - y\]

Substituting $x = 14 - y$ into $4x + z = 47$:
\[4(14 - y) + z = 47\]
\[56 - 4y + z = 47\]
\[z = 47 - 56 + 4y\]
\[z = -9 + 4y\]

Since $z = -9 + 4y$, we can substitute this into the plane equation $3y + 12z = 27$:
\[3y + 12(-9 + 4y) = 27\]
\[3y - 108 + 48y = 27\]
\[51y = 135\]
\[y = 3\]

Substituting $y = 3$ back into $x + y = 14$:
\[x + 3 = 14\]
\[x = 11\]

Thus, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(11, 3, -9)}$.

\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

Let's denote the direction vector of the line as $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}$ and a point on the line as $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$. The parametric equations of the line can be written as:
\[x = 2 + 3t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 2 + 12t.\]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$:
\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + 2 + 12t = 5.\]

Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $t$ that satisfies both the line and the plane. Let's solve for $t$:
\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]
\[5 + 9t = 5,\]
\[9t = 0,\]
\[t = 0.\]

Substituting $t = 0$ back into the parametric equations of the line, we find the point of intersection:

\[z = 2 + 12(0) = 2.\]

<<< checkpoint: internlm/internlm2-math-plus-20b
To find the point of intersection of the given line and the plane, we first express the line in parametric form and then substitute it into the equation of the plane to solve for the parameter.

The line is given by:
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]

This can be rewritten in parametric form as:
\[x = 3t + 2,\]
\[y = 4t - 1,\]
\[z = 12t + 2.\]

The plane is given by:
\[x - y + z = 5.\]

Substituting the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane, we get:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $t$.

Let's perform the calculation:

To find the point of intersection of the given line and plane, we first express the line in a parametric form. The line is given by
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}.\]
Let's denote the common parameter by $t$. Thus, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
x &= 3t + 2, \\
y &= 4t - 1, \\
z &= 12t + 2.
\end{align*}

Next, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$ to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection. Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ gives us:
\[3t + 2 - (4t - 1) + 12t + 2 = 5.\]

Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for $t$. Let's do this calculation:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

t = symbols('t')

equation = Eq(3*t + 2 - (4*t - 1) + 12*t + 2, 5)

 From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4},$ $4x - 8 = 3y + 3,$ so $4x - 3y = 11.$

From the equation $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{z - 2}{12},$ $12x - 24 = 3z - 6,$ so $4x - z = 18.$

Thus, the line is parameterized by
\begin{align*}
x &= t + 2, \\
y &= 4t - 3, \\
z &= 4t - 18.
\end{align*}We substitute into the equation $x - y + z = 5,$ to get
\[(t + 2) - (4t - 3) + (4t - 18) = 5.\]Solving, we find $t = 6.$  Therefore, the point of intersection is $(8, 21, 18).$  We can check that this point satisfies $x - y + z = 5.$

Hence, the point of intersection is $\boxed{(8, 21, 18)}.$

<<< checkpoint: deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-rl
 From the equation
\[\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12},\]we can see that the direction vector of the line is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}.$  Let
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\ -1 + 4t \\ 2 + 12t \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5.$  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get
\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5,\]which simplifies to $1 = 5 - 7t,$ or $t = \frac{4}{7}.$  Therefore, the point of intersection is
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3 \cdot \frac{4}{7} \\ -1 + 4 \cdot \frac{4}{7} \\ 2 + 12 \cdot \frac{4}{7} \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{26}{7} \\ \frac{15}{7} \\ \frac{46}{7} \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The answer is: \[\begin{pmatrix}\frac{26}{7}\ \frac{15}{7}\ \frac{46}{7}\end{pmatrix}\]

So I have this problem here: find the point of intersection of the line given by \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\). Okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what these equations represent. The first one is the parametric equation of a line in space, and the second is a plane. The point of intersection should be a point that lies on both the line and the plane, so it satisfies both equations simultaneously.

For the line, since it's given in terms of equal ratios, I can express it in parametric form. Let me set \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\), where \(t\) is a parameter. This means:

\[x = 3t + 2,\]\[y = 4t - 1,\]\[z = 12t + 2.\]

Now, since this point also lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), I can substitute the expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the parametric equations into this plane equation:

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Let me simplify this:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5,\]\[(3t - 4t + 12t) + (2 + 1 + 2) = 5,\]\[11t + 5 = 5.\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[11t = 0,\]\[t = 0.\]

Okay, so \(t = 0\). Now, plugging this back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

So, the point should be \((2, -1, 2)\).

Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again with the substitution:

\[x = 3t + 2,\]\[y = 4t - 1,\]\[z = 12t + 2.\]

Plugging into \(x - y + z = 5\):

\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.\]

Expanding the negative sign:

\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5.\]

Combining like terms:

\(3t - 4t + 12t = 11t\),

And constants: \(2 + 1 + 2 = 5\).

So, \(11t + 5 = 5\), which leads to \(11t = 0\), hence \(t = 0\). That seems correct.

Now, substituting \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations:

\[x = 3(0) + 2 = 2,\]\[y = 4(0) - 1 = -1,\]\[z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.\]

So, the point is indeed \((2, -1, 2)\).

But just to be thorough, let's verify if this point actually lies on both the line and the plane.

First, check if it's on the line. Plugging \(x = 2\), \(y = -1\), \(z = 2\) into the parametric equations:

From \(x = 3t + 2\):

\[2 = 3t + 2 \implies 3t = 0 \implies t = 0.\]

From \(y = 4t - 1\):

\[-1 = 4(0) - 1 \implies -1 = -1.\]

From \(z = 12t + 2\):

\[2 = 12(0) + 2 \implies 2 = 2.\]

All conditions are satisfied, so it's definitely on the line.

Next, check if it lies on the plane \(x - y + z = 5\):

\[2 - (-1) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\]

Yes, it satisfies the plane equation as well.

Therefore, the point of intersection is \((2, -1, 2)\).

I think that's the answer, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using vectors or something else, but I think this straightforward method is sufficient and accurate.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{(2,-1,2)} \]

To find the point of intersection of the line \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}\) and the plane \(x - y + z = 5\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\)**:
   The given line can be written in parametric form by setting \(\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12} = t\). From this, we can solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3t + 2, \quad y = 4t - 1, \quad z = 12t + 2.
   \]

2. **Substitute these parametric equations into the plane equation**:
   The plane equation is \(x - y + z = 5\). Substitute \(x = 3t + 2\), \(y = 4t - 1\), and \(z = 12t + 2\) into the plane equation:
   \[
   (3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5.
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 11t + 5.
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   11t + 5 = 5.
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   11t = 0.
   \]
   Solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 0.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the intersection point**:
   Substitute \(t = 0\) back into the parametric equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   \[
   x = 3(0) + 2 = 2, \quad y = 4(0) - 1 = -1, \quad z = 12(0) + 2 = 2.
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, -1, 2)\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

**Coarse Reasoning**
To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line and the plane. The line is given in symmetric form, and the plane is given in general form. We can substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the parameter value that satisfies both equations. Then, we can use this parameter value to find the coordinates of the point of intersection.

**Fine Reasoning**
First, let's express the line in parametric form. The given line is:
\[\frac{x - 2 }{3 } = \frac{y + 1 }{4 } = \frac{z - 2 }{12 } = t\]

This means:
\[x = 2 + 3t\]
\[y = -1 + 4t\]
\[z = 2 + 12t\]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the equation of the plane:
\[x - y + z = 5\]
\[2 + 3t - (-1 + 4t) + 2 + 12t = 5\]
\[2 + 3t + 1 - 4t + 2 + 12t = 5\]
\[3 + 11t = 5\]
\[11t = 2\]
\[t = \frac{2}{11}\]

Now, we substitute \(t = \frac{2}{11}\) back into the parametric equations to find the point of intersection:
\[x = 2 + 3\left(\frac{2}{11}\right) = 2 + \frac{6}{11} = \frac{28}{11}\]
\[y = -1 + 4\left(\frac{2}{11}\right) = -1 + \frac{8}{11} = -\frac{3}{11}\]
\[z = 2 + 12\left(\frac{2}{11}\right) = 2 + \frac{24}{11} = \frac{46}{11}\]

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\left(\frac{28}{11}, -\frac{3}{11}, \frac{46}{11}\right)\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\left(\frac{28}{11}, -\frac{3}{11}, \frac{46}{11}\right)}

**Coarse Reasoning**
To find the point of intersection, we can equate the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the line equation to the corresponding variables in the plane equation. This will give us a system of equations that we can solve.

**Fine Reasoning**
Given the line equation:
\[\frac{x - 2 }{3 } = \frac{y + 1 }{4 } = \frac{z - 2 }{12 }\]

This can be rewritten as three separate equations:
1. \(x - 2 = 3t\)
2. \(y + 1 = 4t\)
3. \(z - 2 = 12t\)

Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$:
1. \(x = 3t + 2\)
2. \(y = 4t - 1\)
3. \(z = 12t + 2\)

Given the plane equation:
\[x - y + z = 5\]

Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the plane equation:
\[(3t + 2) - (4t - 1) + (12t + 2) = 5\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[3t + 2 - 4t + 1 + 12t + 2 = 5\]
\[11t + 5 = 5\]
\[11t = 0\]
\[t = 0\]

Substituting $t = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
1. \(x = 3(0) + 2 = 2\)
2. \(y = 4(0) - 1 = -1\)
3. \(z = 12(0) + 2 = 2\)

Therefore, the point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\).

**Final Answer**
The point of intersection is \(\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}\). user

**Coarse Reasoning**

The given line has direction ratios 3, 4, 12, which means it is a multiple of the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}$. We can parameterize the line using the parameter $t$ as follows: $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\ -1 + 4t \\ 2 + 12t \end{pmatrix}$.

To find the point of intersection, we substitute the $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the line into the equation of the plane $x - y + z = 5$. This gives us an equation in terms of $t$, which we can solve for $t$. Once we have $t$, we can plug it back into the line equation to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

**Fine Reasoning**

The equation of the line can be written as $\frac{x - 2}{3} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{z - 2}{12}$. This means that for any value of $t$, the coordinates of the line are given by $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\ -1 + 4t \\ 2 + 12t \end{pmatrix}$.

We are given that this line intersects the plane $x - y + z = 5$. To find the point of intersection, we substitute the $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the line into the equation of the plane:

$(2 + 3t) - (-1 + 4t) + (2 + 12t) = 5$

Simplifying, we get:

$11t = 0$

Therefore, $t = 0$. Plugging this value back into the line equation, we find that the point of intersection is $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.

**Final Answer**

The point of intersection is $\boxed{(2, -1, 2)}$. userFind the distance from the point $P = (1,1,1)$ to the line
